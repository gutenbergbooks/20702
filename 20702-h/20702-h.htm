<p>Startling <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagevi" name="pagevi"></a>(p. vi)</span> as the subject of connecting China and New South
Wales with Great Britain, through the West Indies, may at first sight
appear, both as regards time and expense, still few things are more
practicable. The labour and expense of crossing the Isthmus of
America, either by Panama or by Lake Nicaragua, by a land conveyance,
is trifling. With eight steam-boats, <span class="smcap">ONLY FOUR ADDITIONAL</span> to the
number already in the West Indies, added to the present sailing-packet
establishment, the whole Plan for the Western World, extending it
westward to China and New South Wales, can, in the mean time, as the
following pages will show you, be put into execution to the fullest
extent, with a very great saving in time, and with very great
regularity. A water communication moreover will, I feel convinced, and
at no distant day, be carried through the American Isthmus&mdash;say by
Lake Nicaragua&mdash;when the sailing packets for the Pacific may run
direct between Jamaica and Sydney, New South Wales, and Canton-China.</p>

<p>In the estimate for the cost of steam-boats to be employed in the
service proposed, I have been chiefly guided by, and adhere to, the
statement made by that able and practical engineer Mr. Napier, of
Glasgow, in his evidence to the Post-office Commissioners in 1836,
that steam-boats of 240-horse power, and 620 tons burthen, could be
furnished at from 24,000<i>l.</i> to 25,000<i>l.</i> At this rate the total
yearly cost of mail communications by the aid of steam, to every
quarter which has been <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagevii" name="pagevii"></a>(p. vii)</span> adverted to in the subsequent pages,
will be as stated in the following brief summary. Reference No. 1,
shows the expenditure, keeping the Red Sea route confined to India
only, and extending the communication to China and Sydney by the
Pacific, from Panama or Rialejo. No. 2, the expense, confining the
communication by the Cape of Good Hope to India only, and extending
the communication to Canton, &amp;c. across the Pacific as before. No. 3,
shows the expenditure for the Western World, the work performed by
steam in the West Indies, and steam from Falmouth to Fayal, with
sailing-packets for the remainder of the work; and the whole expense,
by extending sailing-packets to China and Sydney westward across the
Pacific, but limiting the communication by the Red Sea to India only.
Lastly, No. 4, shows the expenditure of the communications made in a
way similar to No. 3, limiting the conveyance by the Cape of Good Hope
to India only: (see also <a href="#page128">Appendix</a> No. 2, p. 128.)</p>

<p>It is, however, to that portion connected with the Western World that
the immediate and particular attention of yourself and the other
members of Her Majesty's Government is particularly requested. The
other parts, above alluded to, may hereafter not be deemed <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageviii" name="pageviii"></a>(p. viii)</span>
unworthy of your consideration, and the consideration of the Public.
Carried into effect in a decided manner, and as speedily as the nature
and extent of the machinery required will admit, it would produce
great and lasting advantages to the British empire, and confer great
honour upon the British Government and the splendid Post-office
establishment of this country.</p>

<p>Permit me to observe, that the speedy conveyance of mails outwards, to
any place, is but a <i>minor</i> point gained, unless the returns are made
regular and equally rapid, and so combined, that while every place
possible can be embraced in the line, no place shall obtain any undue
advantage over another. These points can never be lost sight of in
planning or arranging any mail communication, but more especially a
communication like that at present proposed.</p>

<p>No narrow or parsimonious views on the part of this great country
ought to throw aside the plan particularly alluded to, or leave it to
be taken up and split into divisions by parties, perhaps foreigners,
who will then not only command the channels of British intelligence,
but be enabled to demand what price they please for carrying a large
and important portion of the commercial correspondence of this
country. The Public, moreover, can only repose implicit confidence in
a mail conveyance under the direction and the responsibility of
Government. Further, it is scarcely necessary to <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageix" name="pageix"></a>(p. ix)</span> point out, or
to advert to, the immense advantages which the Government of Great
Britain would possess, in the event of hostilities, by having the
command and the direction of such a mighty and extensive steam power
and communication, which would enable them to forward, to any point
within its vast range, despatches, troops, and warlike stores. From
Falmouth, letters might be at Sydney, New South Wales, in
seventy-five, and at Canton-China in seventy-eight days, by employing
sailing packets only, to cross the Pacific from the Isthmus of
America. Letters from Falmouth, by way of Barbadoes, Jamaica, and
Chagre, could be at Lima in thirty-five days.</p>

<p>To give greater security to the mails, and comfort and accommodation
to passengers, &amp;c. a class of sailing-vessels rather larger than the
generality of those at present employed in the West Indies, ought to
be engaged; and for this purpose, a larger sum annually must be
allowed to defray the expense. Some of those at present employed, such
as the Charib, may do, but sloops are too small for the service.</p>

<p>It is only within these few months that a mail communication, and that
very uncertain and irregular, has been commenced with the British
Empire in Hindostan, containing 100,000,000 of people. With the
rapidly rising colonies in British America, containing 1,700,000
enterprising inhabitants, there is still but one ill-regulated mail
conveyance, by a sailing-packet, each month. Such <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagex" name="pagex"></a>(p. x)</span> a state of
things is neither creditable nor safe to a country like Great Britain.
The population of these colonies must be left far behind their
neighbours in the United States in all commercial intelligence, and
the interests of the former must consequently suffer greatly.</p>

<p>The steam-boats to be employed in the service contemplated, although
of the high power mentioned, need not be of the same tonnage as
vessels of an equal power which are built for the sole purpose of
carrying goods. Consequently, a considerable expense in building the
former will be saved. Mails never can be carried either with
regularity or certainty in vessels, the chief object and dependence of
which is to carry merchandize. The time which such vessels would
require to procure, take in, and discharge cargoes, would render
punctuality and regularity, two things indispensably necessary in all
mail communications, quite impracticable. Any attempt to resort to
such a system, more especially in a quarter where steamers would have
so many places to call at as these will have in the West Indies, would
throw every thing into inextricable confusion. Steam-boats carrying
mails and passengers should be the mail-coaches of the ocean, limited
as mail-coaches on land are to cargoes, and as near as possible to the
tonnage pointed out in the following pages. The steamers to be
employed in the service contemplated should also be built broad in the
beam, of a light draught of water, and in speed, accommodation, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexi" name="pagexi"></a>(p. xi)</span> security, must be such that no others of equal powers can
surpass them.</p>

<p>The liberality of <span class="smcap">Mr. John Arrowsmith</span>, so well known for his
geographical knowledge and geographical accuracy, has enabled me,
without the labour of constructing it, to present to you and to the
public the Chart of the World, between 70° N. lat. and 60° S. lat., on
Mercator's projection, which accompanies the present sheets. On it I
have laid down all the routes of both steamers and sailing-packets, to
every quarter of the world that has been adverted to; and further
added a Chart of the West Indies, and of the Isthmus of America, drawn
by myself, and corrected by the latest authorities.</p>

<p>The timid and the interested will throw every doubt upon the success
of such an undertaking. What is going on in the world is the best
answer to doubts and fears on this subject. What takes place in other
quarters will take place in the quarters alluded to, namely, success
where failure was anticipated.</p>

<p>In a vast undertaking like the plan proposed, the interests of the
Government and the general interests of the public must be specially
kept in view and particularly attended to. By attending closely to
these interests, the Government will find that it best and most
effectually consults the interests of individuals, places and
communities. No partial or local interest or <span class="pagenum"><a id="pagexii" name="pagexii"></a>(p. xii)</span> opposition
(such may in this, as in most other concerns, appear) ought to be
listened to. Any such opposition can only proceed from prejudice, or
ignorance, or self-interest; and a little experience will satisfy the
public, and convince even such opposition, that the fact is so; and,
moreover, that in the arrangements proposed, no interest in any
quarter has been neglected.</p>

<h2>A GENERAL PLAN <span class="pagenum"><a id="page001" name="page001"></a>(p. 001)</span>

FOR

CONVEYANCE OF MAILS BY STEAM,

&amp;c. &amp;c.</h2>




<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>The conveyance of mails and despatches from one place to another is of
the utmost possible importance to individuals, and to a country. The
rapidity and regularity with which such communications can be made,
gives to every nation an influence, a command, and advantages such as
scarcely any thing else can give, and frequently extends even beyond
the sphere of that influence and that command which the direct
application of mere physical power can obtain to any government or
people.</p>

<p>Much as Great Britain has already done, in this respect, to connect
and to communicate with her very extensive, valuable, and important
foreign dependencies, still much more remains to be done, to give her
those advantages, and that influence, and that command which she might
have, which she ought to have, which all her great interests require
she should have; and which the power of steam, together with the late
great improvements in machinery, can and ought, in a special manner,
to secure unto her, her commerce, her power, and her people.</p>

<p>In no quarters of the world could the application of the power and the
improvements alluded to prove so advantageous to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page002" name="page002"></a>(p. 002)</span> the
commercial and the political interests of Great Britain as in the East
Indies, in the West Indies, and in those places connected with these
quarters; and also in all those countries and places which afford the
safest and the speediest means of connecting the chain closely which
tends to enable her to communicate more frequently, more rapidly, and
more regularly with these places; and, at the same time, all these
quarters, and her own possessions, with the parent State.</p>

<p>The object being a national one, it ought to be carried into effect by
the nation, without reference to the mere question of pounds shillings
and pence; that is, whether it is to become a directly remunerating
concern or not. While the important subject ought to be taken up in
this manner by the Government of Great Britain, it may be observed
that the plan requisite, carried into effect in the most extensive
manner, will certainly remunerate fully the Government or the
individuals who may undertake the work, either on the general or on
the more limited scale; but the higher, the more the scale is
extended.</p>

<p>In fact, unless the plan is carried into effect on an extensive scale,
it will not prove a concern so remunerating as it would otherwise be,
because it is only by connecting different places in the line, or
within the sphere of communication, that a greater number, or rather a
sufficient number, of letters and passengers can be obtained; and
unless the communications are sufficiently frequent and regular, both
letters and travellers will continue to find private traders and ships
in general the quickest mode of proceeding on and getting to the end
of their journey, or the place of their destination.</p>

<p>The position of the United States, in the western world, and the very
extensive trade which these States carry on with every part of that
quarter of the world, and indeed with every quarter of the world,
gives the merchants of these States, constituted as the packet
arrangements and communications of Great Britain with foreign parts
now are, an opportunity of receiving earlier intelligence regarding
the state of many important foreign markets than British merchants in
general enjoy, except such as are immediately connected with
establishments in the United States, and by which means both obtain
decided <span class="pagenum"><a id="page003" name="page003"></a>(p. 003)</span> advantages over the rest of the commercial
community. This ought not to be the case in a great commercial country
like Great Britain. It is a fact quite notorious, that from almost
every quarter of the western world the earliest intelligence is almost
uniformly received through the United States. The whole correspondence
of the important British Provinces, the Canadas, comes through these
States. It is also notorious, that, by means of our own commercial
marine, intelligence is generally received from many foreign countries
earlier than by Government Packets. Indeed, it is not uncommon among
merchants to return, unopened, to the Post-office many letters in
originals, they having previously received the duplicates by private
merchant ships. Besides, it is well known that vast numbers of letters
from Great Britain to Foreign States are sent through the United
States, because these go earlier to their place of destination. In
these various ways a great Post-office revenue is cut off, while the
mercantile world are put to a great inconvenience and uncertainty. It
is not befitting that the first commercial country in the world should
remain dependent upon the private ships of another commercial and
rival state for the transmission of commercial correspondence. If such
a deficient system is persevered in, the result will most infallibly
be, that that country which obtains, and which can obtain, the
earliest commercial information, will, in time, become the greatest
and most prosperous commercial country.</p>

<p>It is, in fact, quite impossible that the commercial interests of any
country can ever compete with the commercial interests of another
country, unless the one have equally rapid, frequent, and regular
opportunities and means of correspondence and conveyance with the
other. If the merchants of other countries have quicker and more
frequent communications with any particular quarter of the world, than
the merchants of the United Kingdom have, it is obvious that the
former will obtain a decided advantage over the latter, in regulating
and directing all commercial transactions.</p>

<p>The foreign trade of Great Britain, besides forming an immense moving
power for giving activity to every branch of internal industry, trade,
and commerce, becomes also, from the correspondence <span class="pagenum"><a id="page004" name="page004"></a>(p. 004)</span> to which
it gives rise, and by which it can alone be carried on, an immense and
direct source of Post-office revenue: but the direct postage derived
from the correspondence required in the foreign trade, great as it is,
is small when compared to the addition which the correspondence in the
foreign trade directly and immediately gives to the internal postages
of the kingdom. If it is examined narrowly, it will, it is not
doubted, be found that almost every letter of the moiety of those
which come from the British transmarine possessions, and from other
foreign parts, whether by packets or by merchant ships, (of the
latter, it may be said, a number equal to the whole which pay postage
do, because the very great number of letters directed to consignees
come free,) produces, perhaps, <i>ten letters</i>, on which the largest
single internal postages are charged and paid. This arises from orders
sent to different places to tradesmen, mechanical and manufacturing
establishments for goods; orders for insurance; invoices sent;
payments, in consequence, by bills or orders, and in bills transmitted
for acceptances, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>In all mail communications, such as those which are about to be
considered, the point to be kept steadily in view, and one which is
absolutely indispensable, is to connect and to bring the return mails
and the outward together, in such a manner as that every intermediate
place shall have the full benefit of both, without trenching upon the
general interests, or occasioning any unnecessary detention or delay.
This great and essential point is more particularly necessary to be
attended to in the conveyance of mails by sea to distant parts,
especially if conveyed by steam. In the quarters about to be noticed,
the point alluded to will be shown to be more than in any other
quarter necessary. Without this is effected, nothing beneficial is, in
fact, effected; and to secure the object, a commanding power is
obviously and indispensably necessary. For various reasons, which it
is considered unnecessary here to state, steamers of 250-horse power
each, will be found to be the best and most economical class of
vessels to employ in the service contemplated.</p>

<p>The next and a still more important point to attend to, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page005" name="page005"></a>(p. 005)</span>
to keep in mind, is to have always in readiness, and at well-selected
stations, a sufficient quantity of coals to supply each boat: without
such are at command, no movement can take place; and unless the supply
is ample, and always at hand, no regular communication can ever be
carried on. Wood, indeed, may be procured in some stations in the West
Indies, but not in all; while even where it can be obtained, it will
be found to be dearer than coal. The quantity also necessary for a
vessel of large power, and for a voyage of any considerable length,
would far exceed the room that could be afforded, in a vessel of
properly regulated tonnage. A supply of coals, moreover, could be had
at all the places to be brought into notice by care, and foresight, at
moderate rates, and at the rates taken in the subsequent calculations.
Merchant vessels, bound to all quarters, so soon as they perceived
that they were sure of a market, would take a proportion of coals as
ballast; and others would be glad to take a portion even beyond that,
to aid them in completing their cargoes, instead of remaining, as
vessels both at Liverpool, Glasgow, &amp;c. frequently do, some time, till
they can obtain a sufficient quantity of goods to enable them to do
so: while such vessels could at all times furnish in this way a
sufficient supply of coals, at moderate rates, and still afford to
them a fair profit; such assistance in loading, by enabling vessels to
sail at short and regularly stated periods, would become of the most
essential service to the commercial interests of this country.</p>

<p>The time hitherto occupied by steamers in taking in coals, in almost
every place, has constituted of itself a considerable drawback on
steam navigation: it may, to a great extent, be avoided. Let
carriages, such as are used on the railroads for carrying coals at
Newcastle, &amp;c. be constructed with iron handles. These may be made to
hold one and a half, or two tons of coals (either of these weights, it
is supposed, might be hoisted into a vessel without difficulty), and
be all filled and placed on a raft or punt ready at each depôt, thirty
to sixty in number, according to its importance, awaiting the arrival
of the packet steamer. The moment she comes into port, the punt will
be alongside, and the whole will be hoisted in in a few hours, the
place for receiving <span class="pagenum"><a id="page006" name="page006"></a>(p. 006)</span> them being always, and during the
voyage, prepared for them. In this way 120 tons of coals may be taken
in within a very short space of time; the buckets first emptied,
refilled, and emptied again, to a considerable extent, in a period of
no great additional time. At smaller depôts and ports, the steamer
might hoist in thirty or forty tons of coals during her shorter time
of stoppage; and thus steamers, without any material delay, would
always have a sufficient and certain supply of fuel. The coals at all
the depôts should be well covered and protected from the sun.</p>

<p>Further, on this head, most of the small coal (the best) which goes to
waste at the depôts, may be saved by the following simple
process:&mdash;Let it be mixed with a little clay, considerably diluted,
then made into small balls, and afterwards dried in the sun (a rapid
process within the tropics), and then taken on board with the others
when wanted. It burns with great force. It is so used on estates in
the West Indies for Stills. The saving is great, and the labour of
making it up exceedingly light. A child may almost perform it.</p>

<p>It is necessary to observe, that steam-boats for the torrid zone must
be fitted up and out in a manner considerably different, more
especially in their hatches, from the best and most splendid boats in
this country. For the convenience and health of both the passengers
and crews, those for the torrid zone must, in every part, be more
roomy and airy, yet so constructed as to be closed in the speediest
and securest manner in the event of a hurricane; consequently they
will require less expense in building, and fitting up of cabins, &amp;c.
than the crack boats in this country, in order to make them so.</p>

<p>In all the distances stated, there are, be it observed, included in
the time allowed, three or four hours to land and take in mails and
passengers at every place where the steamers may have to touch; and at
the more important stations, at least six hours beyond the longer
periods allowed for stoppages for coals and mails, &amp;c. It will be
necessary to give six or eight hours at Barbadoes before the departure
of the steamer, that Government despatches may be forwarded. In fact,
the steamer should always, and only leave that island at sun-rise on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page007" name="page007"></a>(p. 007)</span> the day following that whereon the packet arrived from
England, because by doing so, it would reach St. Thomas at daybreak on
the second morning (the navigation at that island is rather dangerous
during the night), clear it, and reach St. John's, Porto Rico, with
daylight, and in consequence Cape Nichola in daylight also, on the
second day thereafter.</p>

<p>The old <i>Galatea</i> frigate might be carried up from Jamaica and moored
at Cape Nichola Mole, on board of which those mails and specie may be
deposited, that require to be disembarked from such steamers, &amp;c., as
cannot be detained till the packet arrives to receive them. This,
however, will seldom be the case, nor to any great extent; as the
homeward-bound packet, whether steamer or sailing-vessel, will almost
always be at Cape Nichola before the steamer gets up from the leeward.
She may also be used to hold coals for a supply for the steamer to a
certain extent.</p>

<p>Let the fact be urged in the strongest manner, that a communication
once a month, to any given place, will never pay, nor answer any great
or good purpose. Mails, or rather letters and passengers, will not
wait for such a length of time, especially when these could, as for
example from the Havannah, almost be in England, by way of New York,
in the interval that would elapse between the departure of one packet
and another, when there was only one packet in the month; but give two
each month, and neither could ever be so.</p>

<p>The arrangements, and the extent of the internal Post-office
establishments of Great Britain, are upon the most splendid and
efficient footing. There is nothing of a similar kind in any other
country, either in management, or combination, or regularity, that can
equal or even be compared to them. It is, however, much otherwise with
all her transmarine mail communications. They are all particularly
deficient in combination, limited in their operations, and inefficient
as regards the machinery employed to carry the mails. This, in a more
particular manner, is the case with the West Indies: the small sailing
vessels there employed are generally very unfit for such a service,
and the steamers sent out to work them, with the exception of the
<i>Flamer</i>, being only of 100-horse power, and besides <span class="pagenum"><a id="page008" name="page008"></a>(p. 008)</span> badly
constructed, are wholly unfit for the service in any way; and even the
vessel named, which is 140-horse power, though much superior to any of
the other three, the <i>Carron</i>, the <i>Echo</i>, and the <i>Albyn</i>, is still
too small to perform her work in proper and reasonable time, or to
stem the currents and trade winds, to say nothing of tempests, which,
as regards the two former, constantly prevail in the seas in that
quarter of the world.</p>

<p>It may also be remarked, that to extend or to add to the number of
post communications, does not add proportionally to the machinery
necessary for the conveyance of these: in other words, if the
communications are doubled in number, the machinery used for
conveyance is not necessarily doubled, nor the expense consequently
doubled. Take, for example, the station between Barbadoes and Jamaica:
with two mails each month, this could not be effected with fewer than
three steam-boats; but the same number of steamers will, without
inconvenience, extend the communication to Havannah, and take in, at
the same time, several important places extra. A judicious and proper
combination and regularity in all movements can, with the same
machinery, and with but little additional expense, perform, in some
instances double, and in many instances nearly double work.</p>

<p>The objects for making Fayal, in the Western Islands, a central point
of communication, are as follow:&mdash;First, it is directly in the course
for the West Indies; so nearly so for Rio de Janeiro in the outward
voyage (in the homeward it is the best course), that if not actually
the best course, as it is believed it really is, the deviation, as
will afterwards more clearly appear, is not worth taking into account.
It is also the proper course for New York, and even not much out of
the way from the direct line to Halifax; while, considering the winds
and currents, the Gulf stream, for example, which prevail in the
Atlantic, steamers or sailing packets will make the voyage from
Falmouth to Halifax by this route as speedily, on an average, as if
they were to take the direct course. It is well known, that vessels
bound to the northern ports of the United States, go much to the
southward of the Western Islands. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page009" name="page009"></a>(p. 009)</span> Secondly, it will save two
steam-boats on the North American line, and two more on the South
American line, for that distance (not fewer than two would do for each
line); which, with coals, yearly, would cost 41,600<i>l.</i> This, alone,
ought to determine the point.</p>

<p>These steam-packets should be allowed to carry parcels, packages, and
light and fine goods, which could afford to pay a considerable
freight. This ought to be limited, however, not to exceed forty tons
in each vessel on each of the great lines (except Falmouth to Fayal,
which may be 120); and the small sailing vessels in proportion. These
things, without retarding the speed materially, would produce a
considerable return, but from which must come port charges, &amp;c. If the
steamers are allowed to become mere vessels of freight, or for
carriage of goods, no regularity in their voyages could be expected.
To avoid delay, these articles could be landed and taken to the
Custom-house in every island and place, and delivered thence, under
the Revenue laws, to each owner.</p>

<p>The greater extent to which combination can be carried on in the mail
circle, and the wider that that circle can be extended, so much
cheaper the labour of conveyance becomes, and the greater the returns
therefrom. Further, not merely the greatest possible speed, but the
greatest possible regularity, is the desiderata in the conveyance of
mails in any country: the latter, in particular, is more essentially
necessary than the former, and is, in fact, the life-spring of all
commercial communication.</p>

<p>The work to be performed, in every quarter, must not only be well
done, but done within a limited time, in order to render it beneficial
and effective. Powerful boats, that can overcome the distance and the
natural obstacles that present themselves, can alone do this.
Small-power boats can never accomplish the work. Numbers will not
overcome the difficulties, nor come, as regards time, within the
limits required.</p>

<p>Each packet steamer on each of the great lines, could and should
return unto Falmouth alternately, and the boats from Falmouth be
prepared to take the longer voyage in their stead. The time each will
have to stop at Falmouth will always <span class="pagenum"><a id="page010" name="page010"></a>(p. 010)</span> allow of time for any
material examination and the repairs that may be necessary.</p>

<p>Without actual experience it is impossible to place before the public,
in a correct point of view, the whole appearance and state of steamers
employed in the West Indian mail service, as seen last year&mdash;when the
whole extent of their voyages was travelled over in more than one of
them:&mdash;imagine a small ill-contrived boat, an old 10-gun brig, as the
<i>Carron</i> is, for example, of 100-horse power, and thirty to forty tons
of coals on her deck; with a cabin about thirteen feet by ten, and an
after-cabin still smaller, both without any means of ventilation,
except what two ill-planned, narrow and miserable hatches, when open,
afford. Imagine a vessel like this starting from Jamaica, with ten or
fifteen passengers, and a crew of thirty-seven people, still more
miserably provided with room and quarters, to stem the currents, the
trade winds&mdash;(not to speak of storms,)&mdash;which blow, and the heavy seas
which roll, between that island and St. Thomas, especially in the
channel between the former and St. Domingo, and indeed in all the West
Indies: having the boiler immediately adjoining the cabin and sleeping
berths, and without any place to stow the luggage belonging to the
passengers,&mdash;and with the numerous mail bags crammed into the small
sleeping berths, or under the table,&mdash;and the public will have a faint
idea of a Government steam-boat; wherein, under a tropical sun and a
tropical rain, the passengers and crews are, with the hatches closed,
reduced to the choice, while choked with coal-dust, of being broiled
or suffocated. No human constitution can long stand this. Without
meaning any offence, truth must declare, that such a state of things
is a disgrace to England.</p>

<p>The most urgent haste and necessity can alone bring individuals to
travel by such conveyances, and none will do so whose time will allow
them to look for other modes of conveyance and transport. Female
passengers, in particular, without female attendants, or room for
them, will never willingly undertake, certainly never repeat, a voyage
under such circumstances. It would seem that, in this respect, the
vessels belonging to the most powerful, enlightened, and civilized
Government <span class="pagenum"><a id="page011" name="page011"></a>(p. 011)</span> in the world, are to be placed far below the
level of vessels belonging to their own subjects, and those of other
nations; although such vessels are expressly appointed to convey
passengers.</p>

<p>With these preliminary observations, it is proposed to consider the
details of a plan for the more extended conveyance of mails by
steam-boats, first to the <span class="smcap">Western World</span>, under the separate heads into
which such a plan, necessarily and properly divides itself. In doing
this, it will satisfactorily appear that the more the plan is
extended, the less in proportion will the expenses attending the same
be, and the greater the returns be therefrom.</p>




<h3>I. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page012" name="page012"></a>(p. 012)</span></h3>

<h5><i>Falmouth and Madeira, or one of the Western Islands, Department.</i></h5>


<p>Either of the islands just named may be made central points of the
greatest importance for connecting the mail communications between
Great Britain and all the Western World. The Western Islands, however,
become a central point, more direct and convenient than Madeira, for
all the outward and homeward West Indian packets, and still more so
for all those which may be bound for New York and British North
America. In short, the packets for neither of the latter places could
go or come by Madeira without great inconvenience and loss of time;
whereas, neither would take place if Fayal is made the point of
arrival at and departure from. The latter island is directly in the
course of both the West Indian and homeward-bound South American
packets; and it may be said with equal accuracy, in the outward direct
course of these packets also. Although a little further removed into
the variable winds than Madeira, still it is well known that Fayal
once made, the greatest difficulties in the voyages of the
outward-bound packets are overcome. The distance, also, from Falmouth
to either of these islands is not materially different: from Falmouth
to Madeira direct, is 1170 geographical miles; and from Falmouth to
Fayal direct, 1230 miles. In the outward voyage Fayal is 300 miles
nearer Barbadoes than Madeira; and in the homeward, from Cape Nichola
Mole, 300 also. The distance between Madeira and Rio de Janeiro, and
between the latter and Fayal, is not greatly different, being (taking
in Bahia and Pernambuco) for the latter 3900 miles, and for the former
3800; but from the course which the homeward packet must take through
the trades, the distance to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page013" name="page013"></a>(p. 013)</span> Madeira, as compared with the
distance and course to Fayal, would be increased by 250 miles. On the
whole, considering the advantages and disadvantages to arise from
making either of these islands, viz., Madeira and Fayal, the central
points, it would appear that the balance would considerably incline to
be in favour of any one of the central Azores, say Falmouth and
Terceira or Fayal. Fayal being taken as the central point to which and
from which the packets for the western world are to converge and to
diverge, the arrangements will run as follow:&mdash;</p>

<p>The steam-boats from Falmouth to Fayal would carry out all the mails
from Great Britain to the Western World; viz.: for British North
America, for New York, for the British West Indies and all the Gulf of
Mexico, and for the Brazils and Buenos Ayres, as also for Madeira and
Teneriffe. From Falmouth to Fayal is, course S. 55° W. distance 1230
geographical miles. Two steam-boats of 240-horse power each would
perform this work out and home, giving two mails each month, each boat
returning with the mails for Great Britain from all the places
mentioned, to be brought to that island in a manner which will shortly
and more particularly be pointed out. In fine weather each boat would
make the voyage within six days, and in rough weather in seven
days,&mdash;but say seven days at an average. Each boat would be at sea 14
days each voyage = 28 days monthly = 336 days yearly; 25 tons of coal
per day = 8400 tons yearly; which, at 20<i>s.</i> per ton, is 8400<i>l.</i>
annually. The yearly cost of the two boats for this station would
therefore be: (prime cost of two, 48,000<i>l.</i>)&mdash;</p>

<p>The stoppage at Fayal would depend upon the arrival of the packets
with the mails from the Brazils, the West Indies, &amp;c. &amp;c., but the
arrangements for all these will be such as will bring the stoppage not
to exceed one or two days, and which will prove no more than
sufficient to take in coals, water, &amp;c. &amp;c. Despatched from London on
the 1st and 15th day of each <span class="pagenum"><a id="page014" name="page014"></a>(p. 014)</span> month, the steamers from
Falmouth, with all the mails, would reach Fayal on the 10th and 25th
of each month, from whence they would immediately be despatched to
their ulterior destinations. By this arrangement Government would save
at least three West Indian or Barbadoes packets, one Halifax and one
Rio de Janeiro packet (exclusive of six Mexican packets saved, but
included in the West Indian department), after giving to the two
quarters of America last mentioned two mails instead of one each
month, and which saving would, at least, be 21,000<i>l.</i> yearly. The
voyages also from England to every quarter connected with this
arrangement would be greatly shortened, even were the communications
by steam to be carried no farther; as every nautical man knows well
that it is between the Western Islands and the English Channel,
whether outwards or inwards, that the greatest detention in every
voyage, whether it regards packets or any other vessels, takes place.
In a particular manner the arrival of the outward packets at Barbadoes
would be more regular, almost quite regular; and thus <i>extra</i>
steam-boats in that quarter, on account of the irregularities in the
arrivals as under the present system, would be rendered unnecessary;
and the same thing may be said of every other quarter to which the
plan and the chain of communication is intended to extend.</p>


<h4><i>Fayal.</i><a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1">[1]</a></h4>

<p>All the outward mails from Great Britain to the western world, having
reached Fayal, they would be despatched from thence and return back to
it, under the following arrangements and regulations. Take them in
order as follow:&mdash;</p>




<h3>II. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page015" name="page015"></a>(p. 015)</span></h3>

<h5><i>Fayal and North America.</i></h5>

<p>The rising importance of British America renders it highly desirable,
nay, absolutely necessary, that a more frequent and regular post
communication should be established with it. This might be done so as
to secure all the Post-office revenue derivable from the letters to
and from that quarter of the empire with Great Britain; and not only
so, but to draw from the United States unto England some of that
postage and some of those passengers which belong specifically to
those States. To carry this into effect, it must be done by
steam-boats, and Fayal made the point of communication from which the
mails are to diverge, and to which they are again to return. The point
of communication with Fayal should be either by Halifax to New York,
or to Halifax alone; from which place the steamer to run to the West
Indies could carry the European mails to and from New York. In each
way the details will be as follow:&mdash;</p>


<h4><i>Fayal to New York, by Halifax.</i></h4>

<p>From Fayal to New York direct is 2020 miles; and from Fayal to New
York, by Halifax, is 2160 miles. If this course is adopted, there
would be no need for any stoppages at Halifax, except to land the
outward mails, &amp;c., and pick up the inward, or homeward-bound European
mails, &amp;c. The steamers, with the outward mails on board, would
proceed from Fayal on the 10th and 25th of each month, and reach New
York, by Halifax, on the 7th and 23d of each month, or in thirteen
days. Leaving New York on the evening of the 9th or 10th, and the 25th
or 26th of the month, with the return mails from the States, and
calling at Halifax for all those from British America, the steamer
would reach Fayal in thirteen days, or on the 8th and 23d of each
month, exactly in time, as will by-and-by be shown, for the
homeward-bound West Indian and Brazil mails coming up to the same
place; and two days previous to the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page016" name="page016"></a>(p. 016)</span> arrival of the outward
packet from Falmouth, after allowing two days to stop at New York, and
having one day to spare, in the event of severe weather on the voyage.
The course and time will be:&mdash;</p>

<p>Two steam-boats would perform this work, giving two mails each month,

<p>Two boats would be quite sufficient to perform this service, and the
advantage would be gained of having a British port as the port for
trans-shipment. Each boat would be at sea 10 and 10 = 20 days each
voyage = 40 monthly = 480 yearly; coals, 25 tons <span class="pagenum"><a id="page017" name="page017"></a>(p. 017)</span> daily =

<p>Thus it is obvious that Halifax is nearer England three and a half
days each way than New York; that much time would, by the above course
of post, between the mother country and all her North American
possessions, be saved, while all the advantages of carrying these
mails and passengers, &amp;c. would be gained by British shipping and
British subjects.</p>

<p>The communications could be carried on between Fayal and Halifax, &amp;c.
by sailing packets instead of steam vessels; but then these sailing
packets, on account of the number of passengers which it is almost
certain would travel by them, would require to be packets of the
largest size, or first class. Their average voyages may be taken at
sixteen days each, with six or eight to stop at Halifax, which would
bring the full voyage to forty days. This would throw the return
letters always one mail, or fifteen days, later for Europe, than if
steamers were employed; but, at the same time, it would bring their
arrival at Fayal to be regular, and in sufficient time for the
succeeding homeward packet from Fayal; for, if they go beyond thirty
days, their return within forty-five days, <i>in this or in any other
station</i>, would meet the central point at Fayal equally well, as to
dates; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page018" name="page018"></a>(p. 018)</span> but such a detention would not only occasion so much
loss of time to the course of correspondence, but give letters a
chance of reaching Europe sooner from New York direct. Two sailing
packets would perform this work in the unavoidably extended time
mentioned, giving two mails each month; first cost 9,500<i>l.</i> =
19,000<i>l.</i>; yearly charges 4200<i>l.</i> each = 8400<i>l.</i></p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<h5><i>North America and West Indies.</i></h5>

<p>The intercourse between these quarters of the world, and also of each
of these with the United States, is already of great importance, and
will daily become more and more important, while there is, at present,
no mail communication between them. A regular, and frequent mail
communication in that quarter has become indispensably necessary.
While this fact must be admitted, it is of great importance to have as
many of the points of combination under the British flag as possible.
Keeping this desirable point in view, it is necessary to observe, that
this must be done, taking Havannah into the line; because, if it is
not included in the British line, it will be forthwith occupied by
parties from the United States, and letters, passengers, &amp;c. both for
all North America and for Europe, from the West Indies, will go by
these States, New York for example. The arrivals and departures of the
steam packets on this line must also be calculated, and fixed so as to
agree with the arrivals and departures of the outward and
homeward-bound mails by Fayal, for North America, and also for all the
West Indies, southwards to Havannah and Mexico.</p>

<p>The desirable object of bringing the most important central and
trans-shipping points under the British flag, can only be gained by
making in this case the run of the steamers to be from Halifax, by New
York, to the Havannah; or from New York, by Havannah, to Jamaica.
While the various ways by which this latter <span class="pagenum"><a id="page019" name="page019"></a>(p. 019)</span> could be
effected are here stated, still the former will be found to be the
most economical, certainly not the most inconvenient, and, on many
accounts, the preferable mode. At Havannah the North American steamer
would meet in the most regular manner, and to a day, the steamers from
Havannah to Vera Cruz; and from Havannah to Jamaica, Barbadoes, &amp;c.
&amp;c. The route and time of these boats would be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Two powerful boats would be perfectly sufficient to perform this work,
giving two mails each month; first cost 48,000<i>l.</i>, yearly charges
12,400<i>l.</i> Each boat would be at sea 20 days each voyage = 40 monthly
= 480 yearly; coals daily, 25 tons = 12,000 tons yearly, at 25<i>s.</i> =
15,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The outward European mails would arrive at Halifax on the 20th and the
4th or 5th of every month, and at Havannah on the 31st or 1st, and
15th or 16th of each month. Leaving Halifax on the days above
mentioned, the steamers, by way of New York, would reach Havannah on
the 30th and 15th of each month, and, allowing two days at Havannah,
return to Halifax by way of New York, on the 14th and 29th, eight days
before the arrival there of the outward European packet, giving
abundance of time to rest. This steamer will bring back from New York
the answers to the letters received from Europe for the return packet
from Halifax to Fayal. These letters would reach New York on the 23d
and 8th of each month. The stoppage at New York by this steamer
returning northward could not be beyond one or two days. To meet the
West Indian and South American packets returning to the central point,
Fayal, the steamer, with all the North American correspondence, must
leave Halifax on the 29th or 30th, and the 13th or 14th of each month.
Considering attentively the calculations here made, it will <span class="pagenum"><a id="page020" name="page020"></a>(p. 020)</span>
be found that they correspond accurately, and that in practice these
will work admirably, and without confusion or delay&mdash;points, in an
affair of this kind, of the greatest importance.</p>

<p>The other plan, by which the communication between North America and
the West Indies can be opened up and carried on, is between New York
and Jamaica, by the Havannah. After considering it, in all its
bearings and details, the former will appear to be the most economical
and eligible. Calculating the whole of the General Plan to be carried
into effect, and by steam, the outward mails from Europe, <i>via</i> Fayal
and Halifax, would arrive at New York on the 7th or 22d, or the 8th
and 23d, of each month; and those for the West Indies, <i>via</i> Fayal and
Barbadoes, at Cape Nichola Mole, Hayti, on the 11th and 27th, or 12th
and 27th, and at Jamaica on the 13th and 28th of each month. The mails
from the westward and southward of, and for Jamaica, would
consequently return to that island on the 7th and 22d of each month.
The distances and time taken in three ways between Jamaica and New
York, by Havannah, would be&mdash;</p>

<p>The latter route (No. 3,) will, for various reasons, be the preferable
course. First, because while it embraces Havannah in the line, it
renders it unnecessary for the steamers to run twice over the same
ground that others do. Secondly, the steamer from Jamaica for the
eastward being able to leave that island, with all the return Colonial
mails from the westward and southward for North America, &amp;c., at the
times, or in the space of time, mentioned, would reach Cape Nichola
Mole just in time to meet the downward steamer from Barbadoes, with
all the Colonial mails to the eastward of that place for North
America; and, consequently, could take in and proceed with these mails
without delay; and it might, at the same time, take in not only the
eastern Colonial mails for Matanzas and Havannah, but the outward
European mails for these places also, by which means these towns would
receive these two or three days earlier than they could by Jamaica.
The Mexican mails might also be forwarded in the same way; but to do
so would be of little use, inasmuch as the steamer for Vera Cruz could
not leave Havannah until the steamer from Jamaica arrived.</p>

<p>Taking <span class="pagenum"><a id="page022" name="page022"></a>(p. 022)</span> route No. 3 as the lines of communication between
Jamaica and North America, then the arrivals at Jamaica would be on
the 5th and the 20th of each month; and, allowing two days to stop at
Havannah outwards instead of <i>one</i> day, and <i>three</i> days at Jamaica
instead of two, the return steamers would leave Jamaica on the 8th and
23d of each month, and reach Cape Nichola Mole on the 25th and 10th,
which place the steamer from Barbadoes reaches on the 11th and 27th,
and the Havannah and Chagres steamers return to Jamaica on the 7th and
22d of each month; thus combining every movement requisite in a very
clear and satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>The steamers on this route or station would be each 22 and 22 = 44
days each month = 528 days yearly at sea; coals, at 25 tons daily =
13,200 tons, at 25<i>s.</i> per ton = 16,500<i>l.</i>; which is 1500<i>l.</i> more
than the other. Moreover, the steamers (two) would be so closely
pressed for time as not to have the necessary rest for examination and
repairs, and consequently a third would be requisite, which would
increase the capital 24,000<i>l.</i>, and yearly charges 6200<i>l.</i> above the
other plan.</p>

<p>The mails on this station may, moreover, be carried by sailing
packets. By this mode of conveyance, however, the mails would be
longer on their voyages; those to and from Halifax, &amp;c., being always
thrown behind one return mail for the steamer to and from Fayal with
the mail for Great Britain, and consequently be obliged to wait at
Halifax or New York for a succeeding one&mdash;but for which, however, they
would always be in ample time. The course and time by sailing packets
would be&mdash;</p>

<p>which will allow abundance of time to stop at New York, going and
returning, and for meeting every possible contingency which may occur
in the voyage; as, if within forty-five days, it would be in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page023" name="page023"></a>(p. 023)</span>
time to meet the corresponding packets to and from Europe. Two sailing
packets would be sufficient to perform this work, giving two mails
each month; prime cost, 9500<i>l.</i> each = 19,000<i>l.</i> and yearly charges
4200<i>l.</i> each, or 8400<i>l.</i> It may here be observed, that if all the
mails were carried by sailing packets on the four great lines, that
the times of their arrivals and departures would still connect and
combine properly, but, as has already been remarked, be always fifteen
days later in the course of the mails between the places mentioned
than if these were carried wholly and everywhere by steam.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<h5><i>Fayal and Brazil Department.</i></h5>

<p>From Fayal steamers would proceed direct to Rio de Janeiro, calling at
Pernambuco and Bahia, and landing at the former place the mail for
Maranham, to be carried forward to that place, and brought back to
Pernambuco, to meet the steamer on her return to the northward, by a
good sailing vessel. The distance is 670 miles, which could be
performed in four days and six days, backwards and forwards. At Rio de
Janeiro the steamer will land the mails for Buenos Ayres and
Montevideo, which will be carried forward by sailing vessels to the
former place (distance 1060 geographical miles), and return from
Buenos Ayres, by Montevideo, to Rio de Janeiro, the same distance, say
in seventeen days, and in time to catch the following homeward-bound
packet. One sailing vessel would be sufficient for the Pernambuco and
Maranham station, and two of a superior class as at present for the
Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Ayres department; for, at the outset, steam
would be too expensive on the latter station, while it would take the
homeward-bound packet too far out of her way to make her call at
Maranham.</p>

<p>From Rio de Janeiro the steamer will proceed for Fayal, calling at
Bahia and Pernambuco (distant from Rio 1000 miles), taking <span class="pagenum"><a id="page024" name="page024"></a>(p. 024)</span>
in the Maranham mail at the latter place, stopping one day there for a
supply of coals, and then proceeding, reach Fayal in twenty
days&mdash;including stoppages, forty-five days forwards and backwards&mdash;and
which, accordingly, would bring the Brazil mails to Fayal to
correspond with the arrival there of the steamers from both the West
Indies and Halifax. The mails from the Brazils would, in this way,
reach Fayal on the 10th and 25th of the month. The route and time of
these steamers would be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Three steamers would perform this work in the time specified, giving
two mails each month. Each boat would be actively employed, or at sea,
39 days each voyage = 78 monthly = 936 yearly; coals, at 25 tons daily
= 23,400 tons yearly&mdash;which, at <i>25s</i>. per ton, will amount to
29,250<i>l.</i> Other charges, 18,600<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The mails on this station might also be carried by sailing packets,
and at much less expense, but the time occupied would be considerably
lengthened. Such sailing packets from Fayal to Rio de Janeiro would,
both in going and returning, pursue the same course that the present
packets do. The distance each way would be the same, and not
materially different from the course which the steamers would take.
The time occupied would be, twenty-seven days out, twenty-nine days
back, and four days to stop at Rio, &amp;c.; in all sixty days. Four
packets would perform this service, giving two mails each month. The
cost of these packets would be 38,000<i>l.</i>, and their annual charges at
4200<i>l.</i> each = 16,800<i>l.</i> In the event of accidents, however, either
on this or on the West Indian station, one spare packet would be
necessary, and require to be stationed at Fayal: this would increase
the capital laid out to 47,500<i>l.</i>, and the yearly charge to
21,000<i>l.</i> Four packets on this <span class="pagenum"><a id="page025" name="page025"></a>(p. 025)</span> station would, in fact,
under this arrangement, give two mails each month; whereas, under the
existing arrangements, it requires five or six to give one mail each
month. In a few days, after leaving Fayal, it is well known that both
the Brazil and West Indian packets would be into the trade winds when
outward-bound; after which, the voyage is certain and secure. In like
manner in returning, after getting clear of the trade winds, the
Brazil, in about long. 38°, and the West Indian, from Cape Nichola
Mole, in about long. 70° W., each could steer to the eastward for
Fayal, with almost certainly southerly winds, and at all seasons of
the year, in weather comparatively mild to that which is met with in
more northern parallels.</p>

<p>By steam-boats the course of communication between Great Britain and
Rio de Janeiro would be reduced to sixty days, and by sailing vessels,
from Fayal to that place, to seventy-five days, making fifteen days
more by the latter than by the former; but it may, however, here be
observed, that arriving so much later at Fayal, would still equally
correspond with the arrival of the West Indian and North American
sailing packets at that place.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<h5><i>Fayal and Madeira, &amp;c. Station.</i></h5>

<p>Under the proposed general arrangement, the mails for Madeira and
Teneriffe could be sent twice each month from Fayal. Madeira and
Teneriffe, but more especially the former, have a good deal of
correspondence with the West Indies; all of which would be thrown into
a more tedious and circuitous route if the communications with Madeira
did not go and come by the Azores. The distance from Fayal to Madeira
is 630 miles, and from Madeira to Teneriffe 240 miles. One superior
sailing vessel would be sufficient to perform this work, giving two
mails each month. It is well known that from the winds which
generally <span class="pagenum"><a id="page026" name="page026"></a>(p. 026)</span> prevail in those parts of the Atlantic, that a
swift sailing vessel would almost always make quick and certain
passages. The cost of such might be 1500<i>l.</i>, and the yearly expense,
say 800<i>l.</i> The expense for sailing vessels on this and the South
American station may be taken as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>From Fayal to Teneriffe, by Madeira, and back, a sailing vessel could
complete the passage in fourteen days, and thus be always in time for
the next return steamer from Fayal to Falmouth.</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<h5><i>Fayal and Barbadoes Station.</i></h5>

<p>On the arrival of the steamer from Falmouth at Fayal, another steamer
would start for Barbadoes, carrying with it all the mails for every
place in the western Tropical World, from Demerara to Vera Cruz
inclusive, and also for Panama, and other places on the coasts of the
Pacific Ocean. The route from Fayal to Barbadoes is, course S. 47&frac12;°
W.; distance, 2265 geographical miles. A steam-boat would perform
this, going chiefly through the trade winds, in twelve days. The
period of her return to Fayal must be regulated by the time which she
has to stop in the West Indies, and which will be more specifically
shown when that department is taken into consideration; but it cannot
be less, from Fayal to Fayal again, than forty-five days, of which
this boat will be at sea each voyage thirty-seven days. Four steamers
would do this work, having one, in fact, to spare, in the event of
accidents, either on this or on the Brazil station, and to relieve
alternately the steamers on either station; and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page027" name="page027"></a>(p. 027)</span> this spare
boat would probably be best stationed at Fayal, or perhaps Barbadoes.
Three boats would, therefore, be actively engaged in performing the
work alluded to on this station; each would be at sea 37 days each
voyage&mdash;74 monthly, 888 yearly, which, at 25 tons of coals daily, will
require 22,200 tons annually&mdash;at 25<i>s.</i> per ton, will amount to
27,750<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The time and course of these boats will be more specifically stated

<p>The mails, also, on this station, might be carried by sailing packets,
and which would require to be of the very first class. Their time from
Fayal to Fayal again, would be, say nineteen days to Barbadoes;
seventeen days to stop in the Colonies; and twenty-four days from Cape
Nichola Mole to Fayal (2600 miles), together sixty days; and which
brings the return of this sailing vessel to Fayal to correspond with
the arrival of the packets from Falmouth, and of the mails from South
America, and from North America, at that place. Four packets would be
sufficient for this station, giving two mails each month. Their cost
would be 38,000<i>l.</i>, and their yearly expenses at 4,200<i>l.</i> each,
16,800<i>l.</i>&mdash;considerably cheaper than steam, but lengthening, as has
been seen, the communication between Great Britain and that quarter of
the world, <i>fifteen</i> days. A spare packet might be necessary, but the
cost of that has been included, and stated under the South American
head.</p>


<h3>VII. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page028" name="page028"></a>(p. 028)</span></h3>

<h5><i>The West Indian Station.</i></h5>

<p>This station is one of the most important, and extensive, and
complicated of the whole, and one where steam-vessels can be employed
with the most beneficial effects. The prevailing winds and currents,
however, render it necessary that the vessels employed should be of
high power, in order to enable them to stem those winds and currents.
Into the Gulf of Mexico, through the Windward islands, sets; first,
the equatorial current; secondly, the prodigious current occasioned by
the influx of the waters of the great river Maranon, and of the
several rivers which flow through British, Dutch, and French Guiana;
thirdly, the current occasioned by the influx of the waters of the
great river Oronoque, through the Gulf of Paria, between the island of
Trinidad and the mainland of South America. These united waters,
directed by the trade winds, blowing always from the eastward,
occasion a current of such force, running westward from the Windward
Islands to the shores of Mexico, that it is frequently impossible for
the best sailing vessels to make their way through it. Steam-boats,
therefore, of at least 240-horse power, are indispensably necessary,
in order that they may not only be able to stem these winds and
currents, and carry a sufficient quantity of coals, but also to afford
spacious and well-ventilated accommodation, both for the crews
attached to them, and also the passengers which may travel by them.
Without such, neither the one nor the other could ever enjoy health,
nor could the despatches of Government, and the correspondence of
individuals, be conveyed with that celerity and regularity which these
could otherwise be, and which it is necessary that they should be.</p>

<p>In carrying a more general plan into effect, no reasonable or
necessary expense ought to be spared by the country. In such a general
plan it will be seen by the subsequent details, that the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page029" name="page029"></a>(p. 029)</span>
steam-boats of the power mentioned, assisted by nine sailing schooners
(at present ten, are employed in less than half the work,) would be
sufficient to convey the mails from Barbadoes to every place of
importance in the western Tropical Archipelago, or connected with it.
This force would give two mails each month to every island and colony
from Demerara to Vera Cruz; taking in Laguayra, Carthagena, Chagres,
Honduras, the principal parts of Cuba and Porto Rico. From Demerara to
Havannah and Chagres, &amp;c. inclusive, every colony and place would be
able to reply to the letters received from Europe, or the Colonies, by
the same packet which brought them; and still that packet remain in
the West Indies a shorter period than the packets now do.</p>

<p>In this department there are two stations, however, of such vital
importance, that the considerable additional expense which will be
required to place steam-boats on them from the outset, ought not to be
taken into consideration. These are, first, the station between
Jamaica and Chagres; and, secondly, the station between Jamaica, Cuba,
and Vera Cruz. The first goes to connect the Great Pacific Ocean, and
the coasts thereof, with Europe and the eastern coasts of America, and
on which former coasts a steam mail communication has been already
concerted. Through the channel from Panama to Chagres will be
concentrated, as it were, into a funnel the whole movements,
travelling and mail communications and money transactions of the
western coasts of America, from California on the north, to Valparaiso
on the south, the whole of which again must converge to and diverge
from Jamaica.<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2">[2]</a> The second station, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page030" name="page030"></a>(p. 030)</span> or that from Cuba to
Vera Cruz, is little inferior in importance to the other, that town
and Tampico being the great outlets of the trade and the commerce, but
more especially the outlets of specie from the kingdom or empire of
Mexico. A steamer on this station becomes indispensable, in order to
secure the safe conveyance of specie, because small sailing vessels
would be liable to be attacked and plundered by pirates. With steamers
all would be safe.</p>

<p>Two powerful steamers would be sufficient for both stations, in order
to carry two mails each month. That steamer to run between Cuba and
Vera Cruz, would always be in time with the return mails for the
following packet from Europe; while that boat which runs between
Jamaica and Chagres would, by returning immediately by the route
afterwards pointed out, always be in time for the same packet at
Jamaica. To stop at Chagres for the mails from the Pacific would not
be advisable or proper, because the arrival of these mails at Chagres
could not be calculated upon with any certainty. If at Chagres when
the outward mail arrives, good and well, they would be immediately
taken up and carried forward; but if not, then they would be brought
forward by it on the next voyage, and in time for the following
European packet.</p>

<p>The mails for Honduras will be most conveniently forwarded from
Montego Bay, Jamaica. With the mails for the western parts of that
island they could be landed at Savannah la Mar, and thence carried by
land with the others, about twenty-five miles, to Montego Bay. From
thence a good schooner would proceed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page031" name="page031"></a>(p. 031)</span> with those for Honduras
and Trinidad de Cuba; and having readied Honduras, return to Montego
Bay by Trinidad de Cuba. By this arrangement, Honduras rather gains
more than by the plan first proposed, to go from Batavano; and the
letters from thence will still and always be in excellent time for the
following packet, making every allowance for casualties during the
voyage. The steamer could then proceed direct from Jamaica to
Havannah, which would save one day each voyage, besides avoiding the
difficult navigation about Batavano. The coals saved yearly would be
1100 tons, 1475<i>l.</i>, which would do more than pay the expenses for an
additional schooner for the Honduras communication; for, by this
arrangement, two schooners, instead of one, will be necessary. Their
route and time would be&mdash;Montego Bay to Trinidad de Cuba, 172 miles,
1&frac12; day; Trinidad de Cuba to Honduras, 520 miles, 3&frac12; days; back
to Montego Bay by Trinidad de Cuba, 692 miles, 10 days; stop at
Honduras 3 days; in all 18 days.</p>

<p>Bermuda being a great naval depôt, a ready communication between it
and every part of the West Indies becomes an object of the greatest
importance. Under the general arrangement proposed, this communication
can be best effected from and with Cape Nichola Mole, Hayti; because
the downward steamer from Barbadoes, with the European and other
mails, will have passed St. Thomas before the steamer returning from
Jamaica, &amp;c., comes up; by which means all the letters from Jamaica,
and every other place to the westward, would, were St. Thomas made the
starting point, be obliged to remain at that island till the arrival
of a following packet; whereas, starting from Cape Nichola Mole, the
mails, both from the eastward and the westward, and also those brought
from Europe, would go forward to a day. Moreover, owing to the winds
which prevail in those seas, vessels running between Cape Nichola Mole
and Bermuda would make passages equally quick, if not quicker, than
vessels running between St. Thomas and Bermuda could generally do. The
courses and distances stand thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>The communication might still, however, be from St. Thomas, the boat
destined for Bermuda stopping at that island, when this was necessary,
one day, until the boat from Jamaica came up; taking particular care
always to be back at St. Thomas, from Bermuda, before the steamers
with the outward mails from Europe came down from Barbadoes, in order
that the letters from Bermuda for Jamaica, and all places to the
westward of St. Thomas, may go forward by the steamer in question.
This department, however, for Bermuda may, it is conceived, be best
amalgamated and interwoven with the Cape Nichola Mole, Nassau, and
Crooked Island (<i>the Bermuda mail vessels going and returning by
Crooked Island</i>) department; as the practical working of the whole
scheme may point out to be most advisable.</p>

<p>In the event of packets arriving from England at Barbadoes within a
day or two of each other, as is sometimes the case under the existing
arrangements, then on the Barbadoes and Demerara stations, let a good
sailing vessel, on the arrival of such packet, take the place of the
steamer for the voyage. Unless, in case of calm weather, this sailing
vessel could do the work thus:&mdash;Barbadoes to Demerara, four days; stop
there two days, forwarding the mails for Berbice by land; thence with
the return mails proceed on by Tobago and St. Vincents in five days,
to the packet at Grenada, found, in such a case, either waiting one
day longer at Grenada, or else beating up to St. Vincents, there to
meet the Guiana and the Tobago mails, and which the packet has time to
do. This would occasion little irregularity or delay, because the
cause of the detention, should detention occur, would always be known.
Moreover, the season of the year when the outward packets arrive at
Barbadoes the most irregularly, is during the winter months, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page033" name="page033"></a>(p. 033)</span>
from November to March, and in which period the calms&mdash;the greatest
obstructions, in many cases, to sailing vessels amongst the Windward
Islands&mdash;are almost unknown.</p>

<p>The same temporary substitute could be applied, under similar
circumstances, on the stations between Jamaica and Chagres, and
between Cuba and Vera Cruz. Even if these places were once or twice in
the year to miss a return mail to Europe, it would not be of such
great importance, because each place having then two mails every
month, the detained mail would go forward by the next opportunity,
while it would save to Government, or to a contracting company, a very
serious expense, which would otherwise be incurred if they were
obliged to have additional steamers for this <i>probable</i> part of the
service.</p>

<p>Further, in the event of any accident happening to any steam-boat on
the great line from Barbadoes to Jamaica, &amp;c., a sailing vessel could
always carry the outward mails westward, when breezes hold, with
almost the same rapidity as steamers; and in her course westward, such
a sailing vessel could scarcely fail to meet a return or a spare
steamer at some of the stations, to relieve it from proceeding
further.</p>

<p>Moreover, it may be observed here, once for all, that by the
conveyance of the mails from Falmouth to Barbadoes by steam, or even
only so far as from Falmouth to Fayal by this power, the irregularity
of the arrival of the mails at Barbadoes, which at present takes
place, would be nearly done away, and consequently no such assistance
as that alluded to would be necessary. Hence, the advantages either
way over the present system are clear and obvious.</p>

<p>Before entering upon the particular details of the West Indian
department, it is proper to observe here, that the point of
communication for the return mails from the West Indies for Europe, so
long as sailing packets are employed to the West Indies, cannot be
altered or removed from Cape Nichola Mole, because, by the general
plan, the outward mails from Great Britain, by steamers, would reach
Fayal on the 10th and 25th of each month, and the return mails to that
place would reach, from Rio de Janeiro, on the 9th and 24th; from New
York and Halifax on the 7th or 8th, or 22d or 23d; and from
Barbadoes, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page034" name="page034"></a>(p. 034)</span> &amp;c., allowing only sixteen days in the Colonies,
on the 10th and 25th (App. No. 1.); if brought by sailing packets on
dates to correspond; so that there is not time to spare, the West
Indian mail being the last to reach the central point, and it would be
very detrimental to have any detention of the general mails at this
point. To make Jamaica the central point for the European mails, would
require several days additional; for once at Jamaica the packet would
take eight or ten days to get up and through the windward passage,
which to a sailing packet, notwithstanding this difficulty, is still
the best. In fact, if the mails from Havannah to Demerara are detained
in the West Indies more than sixteen, or at most seventeen days,
beyond the time that these could, by care and exertion, be easily
despatched from thence, the transmission of letters by private ships
to every quarter will most unquestionably be resorted to; and thus the
Post-office revenue suffer severely.</p>

<p>The capital and expenditure in the West Indian department under the
combination and regulations just mentioned will be:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is necessary here to observe, that the calculation taken for the
consumption of coals is founded upon the basis that the coals are of
the very best quality, and also that the machinery is of the best and
most economical description and construction, and for a vessel of
240-horse power. The time that the steamers are considered to be
engaged in actual work is calculated to include the time passed in
getting up the steam in each voyage, and also to cover all temporary
stoppages. The time allowed on every route and station is, on the
average, more than will be required. Steamers of the force mentioned
will, in good weather and light breezes and seas, even when contrary,
run ten geographical miles per hour; and, within the tropics, with
trade-winds and currents in their favour, at a still greater speed:
but the average performance <span class="pagenum"><a id="page035" name="page035"></a>(p. 035)</span> may be fairly taken at 200
geographical miles each twenty-four hours, although in all the
climates within the variable winds, and in the tropics when going
against the winds and currents, the speed made good will be, and is
taken at, much less. Moreover it is proper to observe, on the point of
outlay for coals, that the work is everywhere, as regards the quantity
to be used, calculated as if wholly done by steam, while it is obvious
that the assistance of sails may be had recourse to with advantage.
For this purpose, those steamers which have to go into the torrid zone
ought to be provided with large square fore-sails. The assistance to
be obtained by the use of sails would save a considerable quantity of
coals; or what is the same thing, using them would expedite the
steamer proportionally more on her voyage, and bring it so much sooner
to a close. Sails may fairly be calculated to impel a vessel at the
rate of 2&frac12; miles per hour on a voyage, and which will save either
directly <i>one-fourth</i> the quantity of coals, or impel the steamer so
much sooner to the end of her journey than the time calculated, where
time is taken as if it were impelled by steam alone, and thereby a
proportional saving of fuel will be effected. The saving effected on
this ratio will, on the General Plan, be 27,000 tons, 33,250<i>l.</i>; on
the West Indian portion thereof 7500 tons, 9375<i>l.</i>; and on the West
Indian and the Falmouth and Fayal department, 9600 tons, 11,475<i>l.</i>;
subject to 10 per cent. deduction, being allowance for wastage.</p>

<p>As regards the calculations made concerning the progress of steamers
in the voyages to be made, it is satisfactory to find, from
intelligence lately received, that the <i>Berenice</i> steamer, of
230-horse power, made the passage from Falmouth, by the Cape Verdes,
Fernando Po, the Cape of Good Hope, and the Mauritius, to Bombay, in
eighty-eight days; <i>sixty-three at sea</i>. The course taken, and
distance run, is about 12,200 geographical miles, or at the average
rate of 194 geographical miles per day. Her average consumption of
coals was fifteen tons per day. The <i>Atalanta</i> of 210-horse power, ran
the same distance in 106 days; sixty-eight of which at sea, under
steam. Consumption of coals, seventeen tons per day. The <i>Flamer</i>
steamer, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page036" name="page036"></a>(p. 036)</span> of 140-horse power, now in the West Indies, two
voyages in succession, last autumn, made the voyage from Barbadoes to
Jamaica, by Jacmel, Hayti, in five days; which is fully nine
geographical miles per hour; and in returning she ran in one voyage
from St. Lucia to Barbadoes in twelve hours, distance 100 geographical
miles, with winds and current unfavourable. Adverting to these facts,
it is obvious that sufficient time is allowed for the progress of the
steam-boats, in every station, under the General Plan now recommended
to be adopted, in order to communicate with the different places in
the Western World. The <i>Berenice's</i> greatest run was 256 miles in
twenty-four hours.<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3">[3]</a></p>

<h4><i>West Indian Station.</i>&mdash;<i>Details.</i></h4>

<p>This is a complicated and important department, and the working
details thereof must be planned as follows:&mdash;</p>

<h4>1.&mdash;<i>First Packet for the Month</i>.</h4>

<p>Immediately on the arrival of this packet at Barbadoes, a steamer of
240-horse power should start for St. Thomas direct (430 miles), with
the mails from England, &amp;c. for that island, Santa Cruz and Tortola,
and for Porto Rico, St. Domingo, the Bahamas, All Cuba, Jamaica,
Carthagena, Chagres, Panama, Honduras, Vera Cruz, and Tampico. This
boat could reach and clear St. Thomas in two days.</p>

<p>The steamer alluded to having landed the mails for St. Thomas, St.
Cruz, and Tortola, should then proceed to St. John's, Porto Rico, and
there land the British and Colonial mails; to Cape Nichola Mole
(Hayti), and there land the British, the Colonial, and the Bahama
mails; to St. Jago de Cuba, and there land the British and Colonial
mails; to Kingston, Jamaica, and there land the British, the Colonial,
the Chagres and Carthagena mails; to Savannah la Mar, Jamaica, and
there land the British and Colonial mails for all the western parts
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page037" name="page037"></a>(p. 037)</span> of Jamaica,<a id="footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4">[4]</a> for Trinidad de Cuba and Honduras; and thence
to Havannah, with the mails for that place, and Vera Cruz, &amp;c.</p>

<p>At the end of the second day this steamer may start on her return,
with the return mails from the Havannah, and the return mails from the
preceding packet from Vera Cruz and Tampico, forwarded and brought up
as after mentioned, and, proceeding, call at Savannah la Mar for the
same, from the western parts of Jamaica, Trinidad de Cuba, and
Honduras; at Kingston for the general Jamaica mails, and those from
Santa Martha, Carthagena, and Chagres from the same packet, and from
Panama, &amp;c. from the preceding packet; at St. Jago de Cuba for the
return mails, and thence to Cape Nichola Mole, where it will deliver
the whole European mails to the packet arrived there, as will
presently be pointed out; from Cape Nichola Mole the steamer will
proceed to St. Thomas, calling at St. John's, Porto Rico, with and for
Colonial mails, and thence to Barbadoes (calling at all the Islands
going up, and carrying up the British mail for Tortola from St.
Thomas, left by the downward steamer) to wait to receive a following
mail from Great Britain.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the downward steamer at Cape Nichola Mole, from St.
Thomas, a fast-sailing schooner to be despatched to Nassau with the
Bahama mails, calling, in going and returning, at Crooked Island. This
schooner, it is calculated, could be back at Cape Nichola Mole in time
to meet the packet at her departure for England with the return mails;
if it could not, then the packet could take Crooked Island in her way,
and there pick up the Bahama return mails for Great Britain.</p>

<p>Two schooners would be sufficient for this station for the Bahama
service, should it be desirable that these islands should have mails
twice each month.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the steamer at Kingston, Jamaica, with the outward
mails, another steamer to be despatched with the mails for Santa
Martha, Carthagena, Chagres, and Panama, calling at Chagres <span class="pagenum"><a id="page038" name="page038"></a>(p. 038)</span>
first, and with the return mails from Panama, the South Sea, and
Chagres, return to Kingston by Carthagena and Santa Martha. One
powerful steam-boat would be in time for the same packet; thus:&mdash;to
Chagres, 550 miles, two and a half days; to Carthagena, 290 miles, one
and a half day; stop there one day; to Santa Martha, ninety miles, one
day; to Jamaica, 420 miles, three days; in all, nine days.</p>

<p>The mails for Honduras and Trinidad de Cuba by the outward packet
having been brought up to Montego Bay, Jamaica, as has been already
stated, a good schooner should proceed thence to Trinidad de Cuba, 172
miles, one and a half days; thence to Honduras, 520 miles, three and a
half days; stop three or more days; back to Montego Bay, by Trinidad
de Cuba, 692 miles, ten days; in all, eighteen days. Two schooners
will perform this work, giving two mails each month.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the steamer at Havannah another steamer should be
despatched with the outward mails for Tampico and Vera Cruz, and from
thence return to Havannah with the return British and Colonial mails.
The course of this boat would be,&mdash;to Vera Cruz, 800 miles, three and
a half days; to Tampico and back, 360 miles, stopping two days, four
days; Vera Cruz, back to Havannah, five and a half days; in all,
thirteen days.</p>

The route of the mail conveyance from Barbadoes to Jamaica, &amp;c., by
steamers, would therefore be:&mdash;

<p>Each <span class="pagenum"><a id="page039" name="page039"></a>(p. 039)</span> steam-boat being thus twenty-two days, each trip, at
sea.</p>

<p>Two powerful boats (240 or 250-horse power each), actively employed,
carrying passengers, parcels, and packages, would do this work twice
each month, with the addition of one spare one stationed at Barbadoes,
or Jamaica; perhaps the former.</p>


<h4>2.&mdash;<i>Windward Station.</i></h4>

<p>One powerful steam-boat (240-horse power) to leave Barbadoes
immediately on the arrival of the outward British packet, for Demerara
and Berbice, with the British and Colonial mails, and from the latter
return to Barbadoes, having first carried the return mails to the
packet at Grenada; thus:&mdash;Barbadoes to Berbice, 450 miles, landing
mail at Demerara, three days; (the mail for Berbice might be forwarded
from George Town, Demerara, by land;) stop at Berbice two days; to
Grenada, calling at Demerara, Tobago, and St. Vincent's, for return
mail, 490 miles, four days; back to Barbadoes, 150 miles, two days; in
all, eleven days: taking with her the return mails from the Colonies
at which she had called for Barbadoes, and having delivered the return
European mails, and others, to the packet at Grenada.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the British packet at Barbadoes, a fast-sailing
schooner to be despatched with the outward mails for Laguayra
(dropping at St. Vincent's and Grenada the outward mails for these
islands, which would be little trouble to it), and from Laguayra to
proceed to St. Thomas, with the return mails for the packet, as at
present, and thence return to Barbadoes direct. The route of this boat
would be,&mdash;Barbadoes to Laguayra, calling first at St. Vincent's and
Grenada, 510 miles, four days; stop there three days; and to St.
Thomas, 490 miles, six days; to Barbadoes, eight days; in all,
twenty-one days. Two schooners would do this work, giving two mails
each month.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the British packet at Barbadoes, a fast-sailing
schooner should be despatched, as at present, with the outward
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page040" name="page040"></a>(p. 040)</span> mails from Great Britain for St. Lucia, Martinique, Dominica,
Guadaloupe, Antigua, Montserrat, Nevis, and St. Kitts. The boat need
proceed no further westward than St. Kitts, because the steamer from
Barbadoes had carried forward the Tortola mails. From St. Kitts it
will return to Barbadoes, calling at all the islands just enumerated,
for the return Colonial mails. The route of this boat would
be,&mdash;Barbadoes to St. Kitts, calling at the places mentioned, 370
miles, four days; and back to Barbadoes, six days; together, ten days.</p>

<p>On the eighth day after the arrival of the packet at Barbadoes (the
despatch of this boat must always be so as to secure its arrival at
St. Kitts <i>before</i> the packet), a schooner to be despatched with the
return mails and passengers from that island, to pick up for the
homeward-bound packet mails and passengers at St. Lucia, Martinique,
Dominica, Guadaloupe, Antigua, Montserrat, and Nevis, and give to or
leave these for the packet at St. Kitts. From St. Kitts this boat
returns to Barbadoes, calling at all the islands enumerated for the
return Colonial mails. This boat will be the same time out as the one
which carried the outward mails, namely, ten days.<a id="footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5">[5]</a></p>

<p>Two schooners will do the work on both the courses here pointed out as
necessary, with two spare ones at Barbadoes, in case of the arrival of
sailing packets on the heels of each other from Britain, to forward
the mails for all the places mentioned, and for Laguayra, making in
all eight schooners for this station. There are at present ten, or
more.</p>

<p>Instead of remaining at Barbadoes nine days, as at present, doing
nothing, the packet herself (whether steamer or sailing vessel)
should, on the day after her arrival at that island, proceed with the
outward mails to Tobago and Trinidad, delivering those for the former
island, and proceeding thence direct to Trinidad, in two days, 230
miles. At Trinidad remain six days, thence with the return mails from
it proceed to Grenada, where she will meet the return mails for
Europe, brought there by the steamer from British Guiana, Tobago, and
St Vincent's. With these <span class="pagenum"><a id="page041" name="page041"></a>(p. 041)</span> collected, proceed on the tenth day
from Grenada to St. Kitts, 330 miles, two and a half days. At that
island pick up the European mails from the islands formerly
enumerated, and thence with the whole proceed to St. Thomas, by
Tortola, 140 miles, one and a half day more; in all, fourteen days
from her arrival at Barbadoes to St. Thomas.</p>

<p>At St. Thomas, having all the mails from the Windward and Leeward
Islands on board, and having there got the European mail from
Laguayra, &amp;c., the packet will proceed, on the fourteenth day, to the
westward, calling at St John's, Porto Rico, for the return mail, and
thence go on to Cape Nichola Mole, Hayti, 480 miles, three days. At
this latter place receive all the European mails from the Bahamas,
from Jamaica, Cuba, &amp;c. &amp;c., and thence, with the whole, on the
seventeenth day, proceed direct, according as may be determined, to
Fayal or to Falmouth, calling at Crooked Island to pick up the return
mails from the Bahamas, if it shall be found that those cannot be got
up in time by the sailing schooners to Cape Nichola Mole.<a id="footnotetag6" name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6">[6]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Second Packet</span> of the month, and all the steamers and schooners, to
proceed exactly in a similar manner.</p>

<p>According to the proposed arrangement, these steam-boats would be
actively employed thus:&mdash;</p>

<h4><i>Advantages.</i> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page042" name="page042"></a>(p. 042)</span></h4>

<p>I. There would, by these arrangements, be two mails each month to
Great Britain from all places in the western Tropical Archipelago, or
connected with it, which at present there are not.</p>

<p>II. Jamaica, with the requisite alterations in her internal mail
communications, would have in all her western division seven and eight
days, and in all her eastern division eight and nine days, to return
answers by the packet with which she receives her European, &amp;c.
correspondence, of which she at present is deprived; Kingston and
Spanish Town alone being able, under the present regulations, to do
so.</p>

<p>III. Porto Rico, All Cuba, the more important parts of Hayti, and all
the western coasts of South America, would, by these arrangements, be
brought immediately and completely within the range of the British
Post-office, most of which places at present are not.</p>

<p>IV. By this arrangement all British Guiana would be enabled to reply
to all its European and Colonial correspondence by the same packet,
but which at present they have it not in their power to do.</p>

<p>V. The inhabitants of Trinidad would get sufficient time to receive
and to reply to their letters by the same packet. From the Naparima
and other distant quarters they cannot at present do so.</p>

<p>VI. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page043" name="page043"></a>(p. 043)</span> The whole of the British Windward and Leeward Island
Colonies would have regularly, and nearly every week, post
communications with each other and with Barbadoes, instead of being,
as at present, weeks together without such communications.</p>

<p>VII. This arrangement would be more agreeable, convenient, and
advantageous to passengers from Demerara, &amp;c. for the packet for
England, and also amongst the Colonies, and consequently more
advantageous to all interested in the packets.</p>

<p>VIII. The same may be said with regard to passengers in every part of
the Western Archipelago. The frequency and regularity of the
conveyances would greatly add to the number of travellers, and also
greatly increase the number of letters sent and received, and
consequently augment the Post-office revenue to an amount greatly
beyond what it now is.</p>

<p>IX. By this arrangement the packet itself would always be out of any
danger, which, it is well known, she incurs by laying at Barbadoes, an
unsheltered place at all times, but peculiarly dangerous in the
hurricane months. In the route pointed out she would be nearly free
from the sphere of all such dangers and tempests.</p>

<p>X. By this arrangement the communications, both to the Government and
to individuals, would be more safe, and regular, and frequent than
they now are with every quarter of the Western World; an object of
great importance to all, but more especially to the British
Government.</p>

<p>XI. By this arrangement six Mexican packets, which cost Government,
say 4200<i>l.</i> each (25,200<i>l.</i> per annum), would be wholly saved.</p>

<p>XII. Departing from Cape Nichola Mole, instead of St. Thomas, for
Falmouth, does not increase the distance in the voyage to England
above 310 miles,&mdash;about two days' sail; moreover, it may be remarked,
the packet at present scarcely ever leaves St. Thomas for England
earlier than on the nineteenth day, and sometimes even longer.
Thus,&mdash;Steam-boat to Jamaica, eight days, four days there, and seven
to St. Thomas even in favourable voyages.</p>

<p>XIII. Great Britain, by thus possessing all the channels of
communication in the Western Archipelago, would thereby secure the
principal political influence therein; but which will otherwise, and
in a very short period hence, go into the hands of the United States,
now earnestly <span class="pagenum"><a id="page044" name="page044"></a>(p. 044)</span> looking about and proceeding to acquire and to
extend the same in that quarter of the world.</p>

<p>XIV. The expenses as regards this plan, would, for the West Indies,
not be greater than for the present establishment in that quarter, the
Mexican packets included; while the communications with several places
would be doubled.</p>

<p>XV. The whole correspondence of the United States, with every quarter
of America, to the south of these States, would be brought by the
General Plan within the range of the Post Office of Great Britain.
There would, moreover, be two mails each month between Great Britain
and the eastern coast of South America.</p>

<p>XVI. A great and useful commercial correspondence, between the United
States, British North America, and all the West Indies, would be
opened up, but which at present does not exist.</p>

<p>Subject on the total expenditure to reduction in coals to the amount

giving the real reduction to be 6,885<i>l.</i></p>


<h2>GENERAL REMARKS.</h2>

<p>The mails conveyed from Great Britain by steam to the quarters
mentioned would in their courses be due:&mdash;</p>

<p class="left05">
     London to Halifax, Quebec, and New York, forty-six days; from
     Halifax to West Indies, according to the distance of the island
     or place; Havannah, twenty-two days; Jamaica, thirty-one days;
     Barbadoes, fifty days, &amp;c., &amp;c. London to Rio de Janeiro,
     sixty-five days, and Buenos Ayres, fifteen days more; London to
     Madeira and Teneriffe, thirty-four days; London to Barbadoes, and
     all the West Indies, from Demerara to Havannah, and Chagres
     inclusive, sixty-five days, and to Honduras, Vera Cruz, and
     Tampico, fifteen days more. If the mails are conveyed by sailing
     packets on the four great lines from Fayal, then the time for all
     would be fifteen days additional.
</p>

<p>Large as the above-mentioned sums are, still the revenues of Great
Britain and Ireland, and their Colonial dependencies in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page047" name="page047"></a>(p. 047)</span> the
Western World (say 55,000,000<i>l.</i> yearly), ought to defray the cost
without feeling any embarrassment. The cost, however, is nothing, when
compared to the benefits and the advantages which the nation and
individuals would derive from it. Time saved and actively employed is
every thing. It is capital, which, if not employed at the moment, can
never be again employed&mdash;a capital which, if suffered or forced to
remain unemployed, or to escape unemployed, can never again be found
or replaced. The exports of Great Britain amount at the declared
value, and including freights and charges, to 75,000,000<i>l.</i> per
annum. By employing steam-packets on even a portion of the present
work, instead of sailing-packets, <i>fifteen</i> days would be gained in
every line of communication. Remittances arriving fifteen days earlier
would be a profit to the commercial interests of the country of
167,793<i>l.</i>, independent of the additional advantages which every
merchant would gain when, instead of his funds wandering on the
Atlantic, or lying idle and unproductive on the other side of it, he
had these in hand, to lay out to good account as opportunity might
offer. Even Government itself, from the want of regularity and
frequency of transmission, lose, in their money transactions in the
West Indies, above 8000<i>l.</i> yearly, and much more in not being able to
learn quickly and regularly the state of the exchanges in the great
money marts in the Western World.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Plan above recommended, conducted judiciously, and
carried into effect to the extent pointed out, would amply repay
either the Government or the individuals who may undertake it.
Travelling would be prodigiously increased. Some of the wealth of
foreign countries would be drawn by it to this country and her
dependencies. Everywhere activity and industry would be encouraged and
increased. The Post-office revenue would be greatly
augmented,&mdash;perhaps doubled. The expenditure also would all be on
British materials and labour.</p>


<h4><i>Cost of the New System and the Present System.</i></h4>

<p>In order to understand the subject fairly, it becomes necessary to
contrast the capital and the expenditure required under the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page048" name="page048"></a>(p. 048)</span>
<span class="smcap">New Plan</span> with the capital and the expenditure required for the
<i>Present System</i>; and also, from data, which, though these in some
points may not be perfectly accurate, are at any rate sufficiently so,
to show the income which may reasonably be expected under the working
of the Plan recommended. Every one practically acquainted with the
subject, with the countries and combinations, with the objects alluded
to and brought forward, will acknowledge the general accuracy of the
data, and the great superiority and advantages in every way, and in
every thing, of the new plan over the present system.</p>

while all Demerara, most part of Trinidad, and all Jamaica (Kingston

irregular, and uncertain; and, moreover, the four steamers in the West
Indies last spring are so utterly inefficient and worthless, that they
must forthwith be replaced by at least <i>three</i> good new ones, to do
the same limited work.</p>

<p>By the new plan there will be <i>two mail</i> communications with New York
and Halifax monthly; two ditto between all the West Indies and all
North America; there will be a mail communication twice each month
with Porto Rico, with the north side of Hayti, and the south side of
Cuba. There will be mail communications twice each month with Bermuda,

<p>As regards the Post-office revenue, it is impossible, in the absence
of full official returns, to state its present exact amount, and,
consequently, the probable future increase. The revenue from the
outward postages to the British West Indian Colonies, Honduras
excepted, is inserted in the Appendix from official authority. Judging
from it, and other data, also adduced from official authority, the
present amount there stated cannot be far wrong; and the calculated
increase under the arrangements proposed, every circumstance
considered, is fair and reasonable. Besides the certain great increase
in all the external postages in these countries and colonies and
places, the internal and coasting postages in these places will be
augmented to a very great extent. Taking the outward postages at

100,000<i>l.</i>; Increase 70,000<i>l.</i>; total 370,000<i>l.</i>; viz., outwards
185,000<i>l.</i>, and inwards as much; giving at the average postage of
2<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> the number of letters each way to be 1,531,465.</p>

<p>As regards the Harbour-charges, in the British Colonies, these may be
given up, or reduced to a small sum for the trouble which the Custom
Houses may be put to; and in foreign ports it should be arranged by
compacts with the respective governments, that the port dues should be
reduced to a small sum, for two reasons,&mdash;because the vessels carry
the mails, and because they are on that account restricted to a small
portion of the whole cargo, which they could otherwise take. The
charges might be made proportionate: there could not be much
difficulty in arranging these points. In some of the minor ports
(foreign), the steamers would not even come to anchor.</p>


<h4>WEST INDIES.&mdash;INTERNAL POST OFFICES.</h4>

<p>The internal communications in the West Indies by post are very
inefficient, even where they exist, but in most colonies these are
altogether wanting.</p>

<p>Communication in the West Indies on business, and in the affairs of
public and private life, is principally carried on by correspondence;
and from the particular circumstances of these colonies, more so in
proportion than in other countries.</p>

<p>The way in which this extensive and general communication is carried
on is by letter sent by servants or hired messengers. These servants
or messengers take days in a particular service, according to the
distance. The latter mode is particularly expensive. The other, the
most general, is scarcely less so, except that from the construction
of West Indian society, there was beforetime felt no immediate outlay
for the service required.</p>

<p>Important supplies are required upon an estate for various purposes.
This is of very frequent occurrence. A special messenger from that
estate must be despatched with a letter ordering <span class="pagenum"><a id="page055" name="page055"></a>(p. 055)</span> the same,
to a distance of twenty or thirty miles, or more. Two or three days'
labour are lost, an expense of 4<i>s.</i> or 5<i>s.</i> incurred, while 1<i>s.</i>
for letters by post, if there was a post, would accomplish the object.
This is merely one point brought forward in proof of the necessity of
internal post conveyances in the British West Indian colonies, as in
this country, out of the multitudes that could be adduced for a
similar purpose.</p>

<p>The state of society in the West Indies is now on the eve of being
completely changed, and assimilated to the society in this country;
and consequently the duty of the Government of this country ought to
bestow on the population of the colonies the same facilities of
communication which the population of the mother country enjoy.</p>

<p>When the Negro apprenticeship comes to an end, either partially or
totally, the expense to estates and individuals for servants or
messengers to carry the correspondence absolutely necessary, will be
exceedingly great, and a most serious burden; and yet it must be
borne,&mdash;or otherwise, without internal post communications, neither
cultivation nor commerce can be carried on.</p>

<p>It is absolutely necessary for the future well-being of these
colonies, that internal post communications should be extended to, and
established in each of them.</p>

<p>Jamaica (and perhaps it stands single in this respect) has an internal
post communication once a week, to and from Kingston, and other
quarters of the island (daily only with Spanish Town, the capital);
still this weekly post is greatly inadequate to its present wants, and
will be much more so after August 1838, and August 1840. In
consequence of this restricted communication, no other part of the
island, Spanish Town excepted, knows of a packet's arrival until it is
gone, or till it is too late to write by it. This important colony
ought not only to have mails from Kingston at least three times a
week, but the various post-offices throughout the island should have
auxiliary post-offices, after the manner of penny or twopenny
post-offices in this country. Every one will be glad to pay a regular
and reasonable postage, rather than be at the very heavy expense,
after 1840, of taking a labourer to convey the communications. Knowing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page056" name="page056"></a>(p. 056)</span> the stated day for receiving and transmitting letters, no one
in the most distant parts could ever be at a loss; and every one, more
especially on estates, would benefit and save exceedingly thereby.</p>

<p>In like manner, the smaller colonies ought to have posts twice or
thrice a week from the capital; the country offices placed at the most
important villages, and the auxiliary ones at hamlets the best
situated for the purpose. Smaller merchants and shopkeepers in these
places would be glad to do the duty at a moderate rate, because it
would otherwise serve them, by drawing customers and correspondents to
their places of business.</p>

<p>Even in the smallest colonies such internal establishments would pay,
and, in most of them, more than pay, the expenses they occasion; while
it is clear that such internal facilities would most materially add to
the external or packet postage.</p>

<p>Where the roads are good, the mails, travelling at the rate of five or
six miles per hour, may be carried in gigs, as in this country, drawn
by horses or mules; and where rugged or hilly, on the backs of mules,
in proper portmanteaus.</p>

<p>It is worthy the attention, and is in fact the duty, of Her Majesty's
General Post-office, to direct some person locally acquainted to
proceed through the colonies, to examine into situations, and to
establish such internal post conveyances. In the smaller islands, as
has been stated, they would defray, and more than defray, the expenses
incurred; while in the larger and more opulent colonies, they would
yield a fair revenue; while the good they would do to every community
will be incalculably great. The West Indies everywhere want a little
European energy and regularity infused into them,&mdash;and this is one
efficient, perhaps the simplest and most efficient way to do it.</p>




<h2>PACIFIC DEPARTMENT. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page057" name="page057"></a>(p. 057)</span></h2>


<p>It has been already stated that a steam communication for the west
coasts of America, on the Pacific, has already been arranged, and is
about to be set on foot. This important object has been concerted and
arranged by that enterprising gentleman, <span class="smcap">William Wheelwright, Esq</span>., of
Valparaiso, after almost incredible perseverance and labour, and great
expense; and has obtained the official sanction and support of both
the Chilian and Peruvian Governments. It will extend from Panama to
Valparaiso on the south, and to Acapulco on the north; and will, as a
matter of course, for the interest of those concerned in carrying the
plan into execution, be so timed and arranged in the working machinery
thereof, as to correspond with the arrivals at, and departures from,
Chagres on the north, or the Atlantic side of the Isthmus.<a id="footnotetag14" name="footnotetag14"></a><a href="#footnote14">[14]</a> A road
is about <span class="pagenum"><a id="page058" name="page058"></a>(p. 058)</span> to be commenced between Panama and the Chagres,
which when completed, the communication from sea to sea may be made in
half a day. This point, as regards the western coasts of America,
being thus arranged, it becomes of vast importance to the whole plan
proposed, to extend from Great Britain to the eastern coasts of the
western world; and it now becomes of great consequence to show how
readily and advantageously the West Indian department can be made to
connect itself outwards and inwards across the Isthmus alluded to,
with Sydney, New South Wales; Canton, China, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This connexion may be made either by Chagres and Panama, or by the
river St. Juan's, through the Lake Nicaragua, to Rialejo, on the
Pacific. The distances and courses by either are not materially
different: but there is the best reason to believe that the
communication by the route last mentioned is the best; and that, in
fact, it may, without a very great expense, be effected by water. To
carry on the communication across the Pacific, from and to the places
mentioned, by steam, would be unprofitable, unadvisable, and
unnecessary. To give two mails each month to the places specifically
mentioned, would require, even fixing a central point in the Pacific
as in the Atlantic, thirteen steamers, at a cost of 223,000<i>l.</i>; while
no more than fifteen days could be gained, compared to the time that
the work could be performed by sailing packets. These results have
been obtained after calculations carefully made upon the same
principles as the calculations for a similar purpose have been made in
the preceding pages. The whole can be proved by considering the winds
which prevail in the quarters of the Pacific alluded to (elsewhere
particularly noticed), and by examining the bearings and distances
inserted in Appendix No. III. These matters being considered, it
follows, that not only no additional expense will be required on
account of the mails which are to cross the Isthmus to the Pacific,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page059" name="page059"></a>(p. 059)</span> until their arrival at Panama or Rialejo; but that resources
from the latter, such as parcels, packages, and passengers, will be
drawn from the Pacific department, to increase the returns in the
Atlantic department. With these observations, it is now proper to
advert to the courses and distances which must be taken, and the
expenses which will be required in this, which shall be denominated
the Pacific Department; the work to be performed by first-class
sailing packets.</p>

<p>Owing to the winds which prevail in the Pacific, the passage outwards
to both Sydney and Canton would be easy and rapid; but in order to
make the return mails from these places meet at a central
point&mdash;thereby, as in the plan for crossing the Atlantic, to save
packets&mdash;which point should be so placed, as that taking it in would
not retard the progress of the mails, or that only in the slightest
degree possible&mdash;is now the point to consider. Beyond the parallel
where the variable winds commence, there is no island of importance in
any position that would be an eligible and safe point for the return
mails from Sydney and Canton to meet in their way to Rialejo or
Panama. To carry the outward mails from either of the latter places by
Otaheite, the Canton packet branching off there would be to bring it,
upon its return, a vast distance out of its way (to Otaheite it must
return in order to get the next outward mail for Canton); especially
when the return mail from Sydney must stand north through the trades
to get into the northern variables. It would be desirable that a good
point should be found, as much to the westward as possible, and
convenient to proceed to Canton; at the same time, sufficiently to the
eastward, or, as it may be called, to the windward, of New South
Wales. Owhyhee may be considered as taking the Sydney outward mails
considerably out of their course, although by making that the point,
the time in both lines westward from it would be pretty equally
divided. The difference, however, and the delay it would occasion,
would not be so much as at first sight may be imagined; while the
short distance that this island is within the northern trade winds,
would render it neither difficult nor tedious for the return packet
from Canton to run down upon it, and there meet the return packet from
Sydney. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page060" name="page060"></a>(p. 060)</span> Christmas Isle, a little to the north of the
equator, might be made the central point at which the packets would
separate, and to which they would return; the Canton packets dropping
at Owhyhee the return mails, to be picked up by the packet returning
from Sydney to Rialejo. This would bring the Canton packet 1000 miles
into the trade winds to Christmas Isle. From thence, with the outward
mails, it could run rapidly westward to Canton, calling at Manilla in
the voyage. There are no other places in the North Pacific where
packets could touch, unite, and command, with the least inconvenience
to the service, the navigation to and from both places. Separate
establishments for each line from the west coast of America may be
considered too expensive, if, by concentration and combination, the
same work could be performed at less expense; and then, by that
combination, whatever letters, passengers, &amp;c. there might be from
Sydney to Canton, or from Canton to Sydney, would meet at either of
the places mentioned, and be forwarded in the quickest manner to their
respective destinations. The question is, Which of the places and
plans mentioned is the best fitted for the objects had in view? To
determine this, it will be best to consider the communication, each of
the three ways in which it may be taken, thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Making Owhyhee the central point of communication, the routes,
distances, and periods, and expenses, would be&mdash;</p>

<p>Six packets (one to spare) would perform this work between Owhyhee and
Sydney, giving two mails each month: cost, 57,000<i>l.</i>; yearly charges,
25,200<i>l.</i> Admitting that the packets on the Owhyhee and Sydney line
take longer time than is here stated, they would still be in time to
reach Owhyhee by the time that the Canton mail came up; which in its
course with Owhyhee is calculated to be 91 days. In fact, there is
thus time sufficient to allow the Owhyhee and Sydney packet time to
communicate with Hobart Town, and to call at Otaheite in her outward

take, she may and can do, in her return voyage, without any

<p>Examining <span class="pagenum"><a id="page063" name="page063"></a>(p. 063)</span> attentively the three preceding routes of
communication, it is plain that, in point of expense, the last,
namely, that which gives two establishments, is not more than the most
eligible of the other two, while in point of time it is considerably
the quickest. The packets going out and returning twice each month, or
every <i>fifteen</i> days, it follows that, on every route, their voyages
divide into periods of that duration. In the more distant, such as the
routes at present under consideration, their voyages, in order to
coincide and to meet with the return mails at any given point, will
run, say, 90 days, 105 days, 120 days, &amp;c.; and within the
latter-mentioned number the mail from Canton must return to Jamaica,
to secure, without extra loss of time, a packet bound to England.</p>

<p>Seven packets would perform this work, giving two mails each month;
first cost, 66,500<i>l.</i>; yearly charges, 29,200<i>l.</i>; which is one
packet more than the Owhyhee plan requires; but that station would
require one spare packet, making <i>fifteen</i> for the whole, which thus
makes both stations equal, but without the combination which the
Owhyhee station gives.</p>

<p>This arrangement for the Pacific would, in whichever way it may be
taken, save the whole proposed steam communication from Ceylon
eastward to Canton and New South Wales; which saving, either on the
Mediterranean or Cape of Good Hope lines, would be, eight steamers and
one sailing vessel&mdash;capital, 199,500<i>l.</i>, and yearly charges about
130,000<i>l.</i>; thus reducing very greatly indeed the cost of the

<h3>THE MEDITERRANEAN, EAST INDIES, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page064" name="page064"></a>(p. 064)</span>

&amp;c. &amp;c.</h3>


<h5>I. <i>Falmouth and the Mediterranean.</i></h5>


<p>To extend the mail communications between Great Britain and all places
in the Mediterranean, and more especially with the more distant parts
of that sea, which will go to connect more closely British
communications with the East Indies and countries situated still more
to the eastward, is now, more than ever, become a national object,
and, it may be added, a national duty. France seems to be actively
extending mail communications, in that sea, to all places, as well to
those under her immediate sway as to others; and if allowed to do so
without any rival, it becomes obvious that, with the command of all
the channels of communication, she will obtain such a monopoly of
political influence as will give her the monopoly of political power
also in that quarter of the world. Such a result cannot fail to prove
highly injurious to all the great commercial and political interests
of Great Britain; and this result ought to be guarded against and
prevented even at a considerable sacrifice, if a sacrifice were
necessary, but which it is not.</p>

<p>Two mails each month between Great Britain and the Mediterranean are
indispensably necessary, otherwise the conveyance of both letters and
despatches, and passengers, will generally be quicker by private ships
and other similar conveyances which may offer. The route can be from
Falmouth to Alexandria direct, by Lisbon, Cadiz, Gibraltar, Palermo,
and Malta; at the latter place dropping the outward mails for the
Ionian Islands, Athens, and Constantinople; to be forwarded
immediately by a branch steam-boat, which will return to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page065" name="page065"></a>(p. 065)</span>
Malta from Constantinople, &amp;c. with the return mails for England, &amp;c.
&amp;c. to be forwarded by the Alexandria and Falmouth steamers, returning
by way of Malta, Palermo, Gibraltar, Cadiz, and Lisbon; a good sailing
vessel being employed to convey the outward and the inward mails to
and from Zante to the other Ionian Islands. It would take the
Constantinople steamer from Malta too much out of her way to call at
any other of these islands but the one mentioned.</p>

<p>As the Falmouth and Mediterranean department is in every point of view
a most important station, so it may be rendered a profitable one;
because it will connect itself with the East Indian communication, and
consequently a very great additional number of passengers, letters,
parcels, &amp;c. will be obtained. Calling at Lisbon, Cadiz, Gibraltar,
Palermo, and Malta in the way out to, and in the way home from
Alexandria, steam-boats sufficiently powerful (240-horse power) would
complete the voyage in 45 days from London to London, including all
necessary stoppages.</p>

<p>Three powerful steamers would do this work, giving two mails each
month. The capital necessary to purchase these would be 72,000<i>l.</i> The
annual expenditure for these three boats, on this station, would
be&mdash;Wages, provisions, tear and wear, &amp;c. 6,200<i>l.</i> each, or
18,600<i>l.</i>; and for coals, 20,400 tons, 25,600<i>l.</i>; together,
44,200<i>l.</i> Thus each boat on this station would be actively employed
34 days each voyage = 74 monthly, 816 yearly: coals, 25 tons daily =
20,400 tons at 25<i>s.</i>, 25,600<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The route, course, and time, from Alexandria, would be thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>N.B. Seventeen days, at 180 geographical miles per day, gives 3060

<h4>2. <i>Malta and Constantinople.</i> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page066" name="page066"></a>(p. 066)</span></h4>

<p>From Malta a branch steam-boat may proceed with the mails for the
Ionian Islands, and touching at Zante to land these, proceed thence to
Athens, and thence to Constantinople with the outward mails. From
Constantinople this boat will return, by Athens and Zante, to Malta,
with the return mails for the Alexandria and Falmouth packets. The
distance from Malta to Alexandria and back is 1650 miles, and by the
course already pointed out, the distance from Malta to Constantinople
and back is not materially different. Consequently, one good steamer
would perform the work in the same time as is requisite to go to
Alexandria and return. This boat would be, each voyage, ten days at
sea; stopping two days at Constantinople: which is 20 days monthly;
240 days yearly; requiring 5000 tons of coals, 6250<i>l.</i>, and 6200<i>l.</i>
more for wages, provisions, insurance, tear and wear; together
12,450<i>l.</i> per annum.</p>


<h3>EAST-INDIAN DEPARTMENT.</h3>


<h5>3. <i>Alexandria and Suez.</i></h5>

<p>The distance from the former to the latter place is 170 geographical
miles. This might, under prompt and proper regulations, be performed
in two days. The first portion of the distance is from Alexandria to
Cairo, about 100 miles by water, and the second is from Cairo to Suez
across the desert, about 70 miles. What the expense of transporting
mails, passengers, &amp;c. over this distance would be, it is difficult to
state, but let it be taken as an approximation at 5000<i>l.</i> per annum.</p>



<h4>4. <i>Suez to Bombay.</i> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page067" name="page067"></a>(p. 067)</span></h4>

<p>The mail communications by steam might readily and with great
advantage be extended to this quarter of the world, and to this
important portion of the British empire. Nor need the channel of
communication stop at the East Indies, but proceed on until it
includes within its range Batavia, China, and New South Wales. The
further the line is extended, and the more its ramifications are
combined and connected, the greater will the advantages, and the more
ample the remuneration, be to whoever undertakes the work. The
commercial and political concerns and interests connected with these
vast portions of the globe, are well known to be immense, and of the
first-rate importance, while no European power is so much interested
in these as Great Britain. With these remarks the manner in which the
communications alluded to can be effected and carried on remains to be
pointed out. The route, periods, and distances from Alexandria, would
be as follows, premising that the price of coals in all these Eastern
stations will be considerably higher than in the stations in the
Western World, as these coals may have to be carried to the different
places by the circuitous navigation of the Cape of Good Hope. Still,
calculating the whole to be brought from Europe, these may be obtained
at the average price of 40<i>s.</i> per ton; while 10 per cent. additional,
for all supplies and wages, may be added to the sum taken for
expenditure in the stations in the western hemisphere, as required in
every place to the eastward of the Cape of Good Hope. And at these
rates all the subsequent estimates are formed.</p>

<p>Three <span class="pagenum"><a id="page068" name="page068"></a>(p. 068)</span> powerful steamers would perform this work, giving two
mails each month&mdash;at sea 42 days each voyage = 48 monthly = 1008
yearly; coals at 25 tons daily, 25,200 tons, at 40<i>s.</i> 50,400<i>l.</i></p>


<h4>5. <i>Aden or Socotora to Mauritius.</i></h4>

<p>The steamer for Bombay could, without material difficulty, drop mails
for the Mauritius at Socotora. To do so at Aden, on the Arabian coast,
would add to the distance 500 miles, which is a material objection.
From Socotora to the Mauritius is 1850 geographical miles. Two good
sailing vessels (brigantine class) would be sufficient for the work of
carrying the Mauritius mails between Socotora and that island. The
time each way may be fairly taken at 15 days, and two days to stop at
Port Louis, gives 32 days for the voyage. The cost of these vessels
should be about 4000<i>l.</i> each, and their expenditure, say, 2000<i>l.</i>
each, or 4000<i>l.</i> per annum. The time from London to the Mauritius by
this route would be 48 days, and the same time to return, making the
mail communication between the two places 105 days.</p>


<h4>6. <i>Bombay to Calcutta, by Ceylon.</i></h4>

<p>One steam-boat would carry all the mails for the East Indies, &amp;c. from
Suez to Bombay; and from thence another steam-boat would proceed to
Calcutta by Trincomalee, calling at Mangalore, and other places in the
west coast of Hindostan, and dropping at Trincomalee the mails for all
places more to the eastward. Going by Bombay, instead of going direct
from Babelmandel to Ceylon, only increases the distance about 270
miles, while the vast expense of having additional and separate boats
is saved. From Trincomalee, the steamer, both in going to and
returning from Calcutta, could, without inconvenience or delay, call
at Pondicherry and Madras. Should the time occupied by the steamers
from Bombay to Calcutta by this route exceed the time occupied by the
post to travel from the former to the latter by land, then in that
case the European mails <span class="pagenum"><a id="page069" name="page069"></a>(p. 069)</span> from Calcutta could be forwarded by
land, while the passengers, parcels, &amp;c. could go round by the
steamer, the difference, in point of time, being not above a day or
two at most.</p>

Batavia to Canton. At Batavia, this boat would deposit the mails for
New South Wales and Singapore; the former to be forwarded by other
steamers, and the latter by a good sailing schooner, which could
always accomplish her work so as to be in time for the return steamer,
and for the next outward mails; the distance from Batavia to Singapore
being 475 miles, thus:</p>

<p>Three, or even four days, out; three to stop, and four back; together
11 days. The nearest way to Canton from Trincomalee is by Nicobar and
Singapore, distance, 2880 miles; whereas the distance by Batavia is
3535 miles; but then it must be remembered, that Batavia is the most
important station, and 475 miles nearer New South Wales than
Singapore. Hence <span class="pagenum"><a id="page070" name="page070"></a>(p. 070)</span> Batavia appears to be the most eligible

general, and to the commercial interests of the United Kingdom in
particular. These would be incalculably great, both to the governments
and to the people. To complete the scheme, it would be requisite to
have more than one station at which boats and machinery could be
repaired. These would require to be Malta, in the Mediterranean,
Bombay, Trincomalee, Batavia, and Sydney, in all five places; the
salaries, &amp;c. for superintendents, rents, and rent coal depôts, could
not be less than 2000<i>l.</i> per annum at each, or 10,000<i>l.</i> The expense

<p>The return boat from Alexandria ought not to leave that place until
the Eastern mails come up from Suez.</p>

<p>The course of post under this arrangement between London and
Alexandria, would be 45 days; between London and Constantinople, the
same; between London and Bombay, 90 days; London and Calcutta, 120
days; London and Canton, 150 days; London and Batavia, 120 days;

<h3>II.</h3>

<h5>ANOTHER PLAN, BY WAY OF THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.</h5>


<p>The above Plan is attended with considerable risk, inasmuch as
convulsions in Egypt, and on the shores of the Red Sea about Suez and
Mocha, and war in the Mediterranean, might <span class="pagenum"><a id="page073" name="page073"></a>(p. 073)</span> cut off
altogether the communications with the whole Eastern World, according
to the route which has been laid down. To prevent such a result is an
object of great importance, providing it can be effected without a
serious sacrifice as to time, or expenditure of money. To have such
vitally important communications as free from being disturbed by the
march of war as possible, is not only desirable, but indispensable, on
the part of Great Britain. This may be effected by going out by the
Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>Adopting this route would connect all the Eastern transmarine
possessions of Great Britain in one chain, with scarcely a link in the
line of communication being dependent upon foreigners, except one or
two, which the naval power of Great Britain could always command and
control in case of emergency. The course here alluded to would
lengthen the course of post to Bombay and Calcutta, &amp;c. to a
considerable extent; but in every part of the proposed new line, coals
could always be procured more cheap and readily than in any quarter
near the Red Sea. The following details, however, will place the time
and expense in a clear point of view, and enable any one to contrast
at a glance the two routes, and the difference which in time and
expenditure will exist and remain between them.</p>

<p>The first deduction is the sum for the saving in quantity and price of
coals, as aftermentioned; the last sum shows the difference of cost
and expenditure of the route by the Red Sea, as compared with the
route by the Cape of Good Hope; bearing in mind, however, that the
expense of the establishment from Falmouth to Alexandria would still
remain, admitting that the route by the Cape of Good Hope was adopted.</p>

<p>In the preceding calculation of expenses, the amount is taken
calculating that the work is to be done wholly by steam, and at the
average rate of 200 geographical miles per day. The use of sails,
however, will propel a vessel at the average rate of 2&frac12; miles per
hour throughout a general voyage; consequently, <i>one-fourth</i> should be
deducted from the quantity of coals <span class="pagenum"><a id="page079" name="page079"></a>(p. 079)</span> used. This will amount
to 31,935 tons, value 44,587<i>l.</i>, less 10 per cent. allowed for
wastage on the whole, is 12,770 tons, 17,795<i>l.</i>, which leaves the net
saving of 26,792<i>l.</i> Next, the value of coals supplied to the eastward
of the Cape of Good Hope is calculated at 40<i>s.</i> per ton, as received
from Europe. But coals may be supplied in all places to the eastward
of the Cape of Good Hope at 30<i>s.</i> per ton, thus:&mdash;They can be
purchased excellent, and in abundance, at 9<i>s.</i> per ton at Sydney, New
South Wales. Ships coming from that place to ports in the East Indies,
and the Mauritius, for freight, would carry these coals, and be glad
to convey and to sell them at 30<i>s.</i> per ton, a profit of 21<i>s.</i>,
instead of making nothing, as at present. A further deduction,
therefore, of 10<i>s.</i> per ton, or one-fourth in value, on the quantity
used to the eastward of the Cape, is to be made, which will amount to
44,650<i>l.</i>, and which, together with the above balance of 26,792<i>l.</i>,
makes the sum of 71,442<i>l.</i> to be deducted from the total amount of
expenditure.</p>

<p>Next, as to the rate of speed&mdash;it is calculated throughout the voyage,
at the rate of 200 geographical miles per day. In running before the
wind, and with the monsoons, the vessels would make more, and in
working against them, less; still, on the whole voyage, or from the
Cape, for example, to Calcutta, and from Calcutta to the Cape again,
the time specified would be sufficient for the work and the distance;
while in taking a circuitous course to avoid the force of the
monsoons, the steamers would make up by increased speed for the
increased distance. The N. E. monsoon may, at anytime, be stemmed by a
steamer of large power, and such as is now recommended. The S. W.,
which is the most formidable, may be overcome by the boats on their
return,&mdash;if by the Red Sea, by making first a course to the southward,
and then standing N. W. with the monsoon on their beam. By the Cape of
Good Hope, the difficulty would be decreased in this respect, as the
boats running southward to gain the Mauritius from Ceylon, would, by
keeping to the southward, soon get out of their vortex; while the
steamers between Bombay and Ceylon have only to keep in shore to avoid
the greatest force of the monsoon either way, and from either quarter.
In crossing from the Red Sea to Bombay, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page080" name="page080"></a>(p. 080)</span> the strength of the
N. E. monsoon would be avoided by keeping in with the Arabian, and
afterwards with the eastern Asiatic coast.</p>

<p>Taking the line of communication, therefore, between Great Britain and
the Eastern World, by the Cape of Good Hope, the expense beyond that
which the line of communication by the Mediterranean and the Red Sea
would occasion, would be, in capital, 112,000<i>l.</i>, and in yearly
expenditure, 39,128<i>l.</i> The point to consider is, will the advantages,
and the security to be obtained by taking the former in preference to
the latter route, prove a sufficient compensation for, and a warrant
to go to the additional and increased expense? The answer, minutely
considering every circumstance, will be, that they are. The
obstruction which the land barrier between Alexandria and Suez offers,
and must always offer, even when unobstructed by hostile force, to the
conveyance of parcels, packages, and goods, is a great drawback
indeed. The competition, also, by steamers belonging to other parties
and states, would, as regards all these, be a great drawback on this
line; and to which must be added, the increased difficulties and
drawbacks which would arise in the event of hostilities taking place
between any of the great powers connected with the affairs of the
Mediterranean. On the other hand, the free communication which would
be had,&mdash;free also as it would be, or nearly so, from any serious
competition by the Cape of Good Hope, the carriage of every thing
being in almost every point and place under the British flag and
revenue laws&mdash;would render this line much more profitable than the
line by Egypt and the Red Sea could ever be.</p>

<p>The coal depôts for the lines by the First Plan would be&mdash;Gibraltar,
Malta, Constantinople, Alexandria, Mocha or Socotora, Bombay,
Trincomalee, Calcutta, Batavia, Canton, Swan River, Hobart Town, and
Sydney: and for the lines by the second plan, Madeira, Cape Verde,
Ascension, St. Helena, Cape of Good Hope, Mauritius, Bombay, Point de
Galle or Trincomalee, Calcutta, Batavia, Canton, Swan River, Hobart
Town, and Sydney.</p>

<p>The course of post between London and the different places here
stated, taking the route by the Cape of Good Hope, would be&mdash;London
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page081" name="page081"></a>(p. 081)</span> and Sydney, New South Wales, 195 days; London and Swan River,
165 days; London and Canton, 165 days; London and Batavia, 135 days;
London and Calcutta, 135 days; London and Bombay, 135 days; London and
the Mauritius, 105 days; and London and the Cape of Good Hope, 75
days, &amp;c. &amp;c., but in working the scheme some stoppages may perhaps be
cut off.</p>

<h2>GEOGRAPHICAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE <span class="pagenum"><a id="page083" name="page083"></a>(p. 083)</span> ISTHMUS OF AMERICA,<br>

<span class="smcap">and the practicability of</span><br>

A COMMUNICATION WITH CHINA AND NEW SOUTH WALES WESTWARD THROUGH IT.</h2>


<p>A ready and safe communication with these important places, and at the
same time with all the most eastern parts of Asia, with all the
Islands in the Pacific Ocean, and with all the western coasts of the
great continent of America, it will be readily allowed, is of the
utmost importance to Great Britain and to the whole civilized world.</p>

<p>Through the isthmus of central America only, a short, safe, and easy
passage from Europe to the eastern parts of Asia and the Pacific
Ocean, can be effected. That a passage over the Pole exists, is
extremely probable, nay, it may be said, is certain. This passage,
when found, will be obtained by standing north between Nova Zembla and
Spitzbergen, and thence over the Pole, inclining first eastward above
Europe, and thence westward for some distance, to Behring's Straits.
But admitting that there is a passage open by this route, it can only
be so from the end of May to the middle of September, and during this
period only comparatively safe; a period much too short to accomplish
a voyage out and back from China, and scarcely sufficient to perform
the voyage out and back between Great Britain and her territories on
the west coast of America situated to the north of Columbia River.
Moreover, even if a passage this way was open for a period sufficient
to enable the navigator to accomplish the voyage to either of the
quarters alluded to, still <span class="pagenum"><a id="page084" name="page084"></a>(p. 084)</span> it will appear, when the
distances come to be noticed and contrasted, that, considering the
winds and the weather which ships would encounter in passing over the
North Pole into the Pacific, as contrasted with those which they would
most certainly meet with in sailing westward through tropical seas, by
the Isthmus of America; that the latter route would, upon the whole,
be the best, and in all respects preferable and most expeditious.</p>

<p>A communication by the latter quarter may be advantageously and
speedily opened up, both for steamers and for sailing vessels; and in
the conveyance of mails, both or either may be employed, as shall
appear to be most eligible and most advisable. To lay open such a
communication as this would prove, is an object of the first
importance, worthy of the attention of any body of men, and of any
nation, but more especially of a nation like Great Britain, to support
and to patronize in every way. By this route, all vessels, mails, and
merchandise could reach the more distant and wealthy parts of Asia and
Australasia, sooner and safer, and through seas comparatively always
tranquil, borne by winds scarcely ever varying, and always favourable,
than these can do by any other course that is known, or that remains
to be discovered. In an especial manner, this would be the case as
regards all the western coasts of America, North and South, the
Islands in the Pacific, New South Wales and Van Dieman's Land, Japan,
China, Eastern Siberia, &amp;c. The perpetual trade-winds would bear
vessels before them from Madeira to Canton, and almost to Sydney,
while in returning they would merely have to run through these
trade-winds, with a steady breeze on the beam, until they reached the
latitude of 30° to 32° north, when the steady and certain, and strong
westerly and south-west winds, would bear them in these parallels
first, to the west coast of America; from which point winds off the
land, and north-easterly trade-winds, would carry them, in the second
place, to the point of communication with the Atlantic, through the
Isthmus of central America; from which they, in the third place, would
run to the north, carried by the trade-winds and the Gulf stream, into
and through the Gulf of Florida, into the variable winds, which would
quickly bear <span class="pagenum"><a id="page085" name="page085"></a>(p. 085)</span> them to all the eastern ports of North America,
and to all the ports in Europe, or along the coasts of the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p>By this channel, namely, through the Isthmus of central America, the
valuable, but almost unknown, British territory on the west coast of
North America, would be brought near, and cleared, and cultivated. So
also would the whole remaining western coast of America, from Nootka
Sound to the southern extremity of Chili, be brought near to the
civilized world, and become, in consequence, also peopled, cleared,
and cultivated. Without such a communication is opened up, these
coasts, and states upon them, can scarcely ever be brought to this
state, but to which it is most desirable for the general interests of
the world, and of the human race in it, that they should be brought.
Situated as they are, there is no produce of their soil which their
inhabitants can raise that can bear the expense of carriage to enable
it to come into competition in the general markets of the world, with
similar articles raised in other countries, which are all more
accessible and placed nearer markets; and unless the soil of the
western coasts of America and the islands in the Pacific are brought
into cultivation, and peopled by people more civilized and
industrious, it is obvious that these countries and the states and
population at present in them, must remain in the poor, ignorant,
miserable, and uncultivated state and condition in which they are, of
little service to themselves or to the remainder of the world.</p>

<p>The points where the communication between the Atlantic and the
Pacific are most feasible and practicable, is at one point on the
southern boundaries of the Republic of Mexico, and the others within
the territories of the Republics of Guatemala and Venezuela. The neck
of land, or isthmus, which connects North and South America together,
may be taken to extend from 8° N. lat., in the meridian of 77° W.
long., to the parallel of 18° or 19° N. lat. in the meridian of 100°
W. long. Narrow as the continent of America is in all this space, but
more especially in the southern portion of this space, recent surveys
have reduced it still more; and it is not improbable that, when the
late surveys of the west coasts within the tropics are published, that
it will be found to be still narrower, and more contracted <span class="pagenum"><a id="page086" name="page086"></a>(p. 086)</span>
than is supposed, or than the late accurate surveys by Captain Owen,
under the orders also of the British Government, of the shores of the
Gulf of Mexico, have shown it to be; and consequently the
communication between the Atlantic and the Pacific will be found to be
still shorter and more easy than it has been, or is even now
considered to be.</p>

<p>The first two points within the limits above mentioned, where
communications are most practicable, are the following:&mdash;<i>First</i>, in
the territory of Mexico, from the mouth of the river Guazacoalcos, on
the Gulf of Mexico, to the mouth of the Chimalapa, in the Gulf of
Tehuantepec, on the Pacific, between the parallels of 16&frac12;° to
18&frac12;° N. lat. The distance from sea to sea at this part is 92
geographical miles, in a south-west direction. The sources of the
streams which flow, the one eastward into the Gulf of Mexico, and the
other westward, into the Pacific, come within the short distance of 20
miles of each other. <i>Secondly</i>, The channel from the Gulf of Dolce,
which communicates with the Gulf of Mexico, to the southward of
Honduras or the Balize, to Trinidad, situate on a bay in the Pacific,
to the north of Point Remedios. The distance of the Gulf of Dolce to
the Pacific, at the point just mentioned, is 60 geographical miles,
with the advantages of the courses of rivers which bend their courses
to the opposite oceans. But if it is correct that the River Balize is,
as it has been stated to be, navigable upwards in its course to a
distance of 200 miles, then it must penetrate so deeply into the
continent, that its sources must approach to points still nearer to
the Pacific than the Gulf of Dolce, or its tributary streams. It is
doubtful, however, if any canals could be cut in either of the lines
mentioned, because the land rises very considerably, forming in the
central parts what is denominated Table Land, and is in general
studded with ridges and high volcanic mountains, while the ports on
either shore are neither very commodious nor of safe approach. There
has been of late years also a tolerable good road constructed in the
first-mentioned line, which will tend greatly to facilitate the
communication from sea to sea, so far as the interests of Mexico are
immediately concerned.</p>

<p>These <span class="pagenum"><a id="page087" name="page087"></a>(p. 087)</span> points adverted to are the only probable channels of
communication to the northward of the River St. Juan and Lake
Nicaragua, which, like the last-noticed line, are situated in the
territory of the Republic of central America, the capital of which is
San Salvador. For reasons which will subsequently be adduced, the
consideration of this important position is left until those points in
the Isthmus of Panama and Darien have been particularly noticed and
examined.</p>

<p>The first points to examine are those which are situated to the
southward and eastward of Panama, and which are immediately connected
with, and contiguous to, the Gulf of Darien. These are as follow:&mdash;In
the province of Choco, famous for its gold mines, there is a ravine
called Rapsadura, extending between a head branch of the River St.
Juan, which, after a course from N. E. by N. to S. W. by S., falls
into the Pacific in lat. 4°5' N.; and the river of Quito, one of the
head branches of the River Atrato, which flows in nearly a due north
course into the Gulf of Darien. Through the ravine just mentioned, the
parish priest of Novita dug a small canal in 1778, which was navigable
during the rainy season, and by which canoes, laden with coffee and
other produce, passed from one sea to another, a distance of 250
miles; as they found it requisite and convenient.</p>

<p>The next point, and more to the north beyond Cape St. Francisco de
Solano, in about 7°30' N. lat. is, from the mouth of the Cupica, or
Tupica, as it is denominated in some maps, along that stream, which
descends from the eastward into the Pacific, through a break in the
mountains to the head of the river Naipi, a distance of from 15 to 20
miles only. The latter river is deep and navigable, and flows through
a lake of considerable magnitude, nearly due east, into the River
Atrato, a little below the village of Zitara, about 60 miles from the
mouth of the latter stream, in the Gulf of Darien. The distance from
the Pacific to the Atrato, through the channels mentioned, is only 60
geographical miles. The Atrato springs (its farthest branch the Rio
Chame) in the rising ground, in 5°40' N. lat. and 75° 15' W. long.,
and runs almost due north, a distance of 200 miles, into the Gulf of
Darien. At this point, the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page088" name="page088"></a>(p. 088)</span> western and secondary chain of
the Andes is broken and interrupted, and there is good reason to
believe that they continue to be so in several places more to the
northward: in fact, that they cease, and are succeeded through all the
Isthmus of Darien and Panama, by a low range, broken into fragments in
different places. At the point under consideration, namely, by the
Cupica and the Naipi, the Spanish Government had it in contemplation,
about forty years ago, to open a communication from sea to sea, by
means of a canal; but the events in Europe, and the decay of their
power, prevented the important enterprise from being undertaken. The
Gulf of Darien, and the course of the Atrato, were rigidly guarded and
concealed by the Spanish Government, so much so, that by special
decrees the punishment of death was denounced against every one who
should either permit or attempt the exploration of the country in
these parts. This showed clearly that their practical knowledge gave
them to know, that a communication between the Atlantic and the
Pacific was easy and practicable in more places than one in this
quarter of their dominions.</p>

<p>The next point where the communication is practicable, either by water
or a short distance by land, where a canal could be cut, or a road
made, is between the Gulf of St. Miguel on the Pacific, to the bottom
of the Gulf of Darien, due east, and also to the Port de Escoces, or
<i>New Edinburgh</i>, more to the N. (N. E. by E. from St. Miguel) in the
upper part of the Gulf of Darien, on the Atlantic. The distance from
the head of the Gulf of St. Miguel to the latter point is 30 miles,
and to the former 45 to 50 miles, but with river communications to
within 16 miles of the latter, and 10 miles of the former. The Gulf of
St. Miguel opens to the Pacific from 8°8' to 8°17' N. lat., and runs
E. N. E. and N. E. by E., fully 22 miles into the country, its centre
crossing the meridian of 78° W. long. As has been shortly adverted to,
the rivers which seem to form the Gulf of St. Miguel run deeply into
the country, both to the S. E. and to the N. E., one particularly, the
Chuqunaque, with an extremely zigzag course between ridges of
mountains, is laid down to within 10 miles of New Edinburgh; which, by
the last Admiralty charts, drawn from the best <span class="pagenum"><a id="page089" name="page089"></a>(p. 089)</span> Spanish
authorities, is placed in 8° 55' N. lat. and 76° 45' W. long. To the
S. E. the source of streams which run into the Gulf of San Miguel
spring within 15 miles of the mouth of the Atrato, while branches of
each approach within half that distance of each other. The land in
this quarter is clearly low, because, for a considerable distance from
its mouth, the Atrato runs through a very marshy and flooded country.
New Edinburgh, or Port de Escoces, is an excellent port, commodious,
and well sheltered, and is the celebrated spot where, in 1699 (one
hundred and thirty-eight years ago), the Scotch colony, under the
direction of a Scotch clergyman, named Paterson, a most intelligent
and enterprising man, was established, in order to open up a
communication between both seas, and which was afterwards so
shamefully, disgracefully, stupidly, and unguardedly abandoned by the
then Government of Great Britain, spurred on to the act by the
miserable and contracted commercial rivalry of England and Holland;
and afterwards by the jealousies, the fears, and the representations
of the Government of Spain, which at that time had really no right to
the country, the natives thereof being independent of, and at war
with, Spain. The Gulf of Darien is of easy entrance, and penetrates
southward to a little beyond the 8° of N. lat., and to the southward
of the principal mouth of the Atrato; the centre of the bottom of the
Gulf being in the meridian of 76° 55' W. longitude.</p>

<p>The next and last point to the southward and the eastward of Chagre is
by the river of Chopo, about 25 miles to the eastward of Panama.
Narrow as the land in this quarter has been held to be, still the
charts and maps lately published by individuals, and by the authority
of the Admiralty, show that it is much narrower than what has hitherto
been calculated upon; and in the particular point under consideration,
very narrow indeed. From the mouth of the River Chopo, opposite the
little island Chepillo in the Pacific, to the bottom of the Gulf of
St. Blas or Mandinga on the Atlantic, is only about 20 miles (some
maps make it still less). In this space, the mountains to the eastward
of the high chain S. of Point Manzanillo and Porto Bello, which give
rise to the Chagres, and its <span class="pagenum"><a id="page090" name="page090"></a>(p. 090)</span> tributary streams, running
first westward and then north-west into the Atlantic, are again,
according to Captain Lloyd, interrupted and broken, affording thereby
a readier communication between the two great oceans, the Atlantic,
and the Pacific. In an apparently good Spanish map of the Isthmus,
upon a large scale, the River Chopo or Bayano is represented as being
formed by two branches, one under the name of the Rio Canizas,
springing to the southward of the Pico de Carti, a hill only four
miles from the Atlantic, in the Bay of Mandinga; the whole course of
the river to the Pacific on a general south bearing, being only 22
miles. The source of the Chagres comes within 15 miles of the lower
course of the Chopo; and some good maps lay down a river which joins
the Chopo, near its mouth, as coming from the N. E., its sources
likewise being within a very few miles of the Atlantic. Here,
certainly, is a point from which, and on which a communication could
be opened up at any rate by a good road, so as to afford a speedy
conveyance for passengers, mails, and goods, between the two seas;
while it is also exceedingly probable that, even in this short space,
great facilities and assistance could be obtained by canal navigation,
and by the rivers just mentioned.</p>

<p>The points, however, where a canal could be cut of sufficient depth to
admit the passage of large ships, and thus save the delay and the
expense which loading and unloading cargoes would occasion, where
roads of any description remain the only means of communication, and
where the approach on either coast is safe, and interior water
communication most abundant, are, certainly, the points which should
be fixed upon and selected, in order to effect the object so important
to the whole world. The two points hitherto the best known, and
considered to be the best adapted for the purpose, are, first, the
line from Chagre on the Atlantic, to Panama on the Pacific; and
secondly, the line, perhaps the best of the whole, from the mouth of
the River St. Juan on the Atlantic, by that river and Lake Nicaragua,
to Rialejo, or Gulf Papagayo, on the Pacific.</p>

<p>The Panama line comes most properly the first point for consideration.
Here the survey, by Lieutenant Lloyd, in 1829, gives some certain
data, and some curious and important information. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page091" name="page091"></a>(p. 091)</span> He tells
us pointedly, from actual observation, that which good Spanish maps
indicated, and what was more vaguely told by others. According to him,
on the eastern side of the province of Veragua, the Cordillera breaks
into detached mountains, their sides exhibiting only bare rock, almost
perpendicular. To these, as approaching nearer Panama, succeed
numerous conical mountains, arising out of savannahs and plains, and
seldom exceeding from 300 to 500 feet. "Finally," says he, "between
Chagre on the Atlantic side, and Chorera on the Pacific, these conical
mountains are not so numerous, having plains of great extent,
interspersed with occasional ranges of hills of inconsiderable
height."</p>

<p>Such is the Isthmus of Panama, where the distance from sea to sea is,
even according to the present charts, only 30 geographical miles, and
from the mouth of the Chagre to Panama, 33 miles.<a id="footnotetag18" name="footnotetag18"></a><a href="#footnote18">[18]</a> Of this distance
the Chagre, which has a circuitous course, is navigable for 40 miles
to Cruces&mdash;distant from the sea in a direct line 21 miles, and from
Panama 14 miles. At its mouth the Chagre is one-fourth of a mile
broad, and at Cruces about 150 feet: in its middle course the depth is
24 feet. The current runs at the rate of from three to four miles per
hour. It is full of numerous, constantly shifting sand banks, and
sunken trees, which, with the current, render the navigation <span class="pagenum"><a id="page092" name="page092"></a>(p. 092)</span>
tedious, difficult, and even dangerous. At its mouth the coast is very
sickly, as indeed the country through its course also is; but when the
land is cleared, it will doubtless become more healthy. When the
current is very rapid, it requires four or five days to reach Cruces.
The height of the land which intervenes between Cruces and Panama, has
been accurately ascertained by Mr. Lloyd; and that portion of the
country which he passed over in his survey along the old road to
Panama, is certainly the most elevated of the whole, as is shown in
the following summary of his survey.</p>

<p>This survey commenced from the eastern suburb of Panama, at high-water
mark, and ran along the old road to Porto Bello, unto the point where
it crossed the Rio Chagre,&mdash;a distance of 1828 chains, 22&frac34; miles.
The highest land passed over was the ridge Maria Henrique, 12&frac34;
miles from Panama, and 10 from the Chagre. Its height is 633.32 feet.
The point where the road approaches the river, is 169.840 feet above
the level of high-water mark at Panama; and the bed of the river from
whence the survey commenced downwards, is 152.55 feet. Descending the
river 1545 chains, 19&frac12; miles, Mr. Lloyd came to the village of
Cruces, after a descent of 114.60 feet; thus making Cruces to be 37.96
feet above high-water mark at Panama. From Cruces to Gorgona 410
chains, 5&frac14; miles, the fall is 16.13 feet; and thence to a small
gravel bank, named "<i>Playa los Ingenieros</i>" distant from Cruces 1302
chains, 16&frac34; miles, the fall is 21.82 feet, precisely level with the
high-water mark at Panama. At 2682 chains, 33&frac12; miles below Cruces,
Mr. Lloyd first observed the effects of the tide from the Atlantic,
the level of the river at this point being 13.65 feet below the level
of high-water mark on the Pacific. At 507 chains, 12 miles, further
down, reached La Bruja, where the water became brackish; the level of
the surface of the river being 13.55 feet below the high-water mark at
Panama. From La Bruja there was no perceptible descent to the
Atlantic. The whole distance gone over in levelling from sea to sea,
was 82 miles.</p>

<p>The tide at the mouth of the Chagre rises only one foot, or 1.16 feet;
but at Panama the spring-tide in the Pacific rises in a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page093" name="page093"></a>(p. 093)</span> mean
level to the height of 21.22 feet, though high winds and currents
occasionally raise them to the height of 27.44 feet. At low water the
sea sinks proportionally at Panama below the level of the Atlantic:
the reason for this difference is obvious. The current towards the
Gulf of Mexico, and which afterwards forms the famous gulf stream,
carries off rapidly the waters in the Atlantic; while, on the
contrary, the current which flows northward along the western coast of
South America, and the tide which flows into the bay of Panama, from
the south-west from the Pacific, heaps, as it were for a moment, the
waters into the bay and on the shores of Panama, and occasions the
tides alluded to, and differing so greatly from those which are seen
in the Atlantic at the short distance on the opposite coast.</p>

<p>From Maria Henrique to Cruces is only about nine miles. In the
intermediate spaces are several savannahs, and, according to the
Spanish maps, a very considerable river, called Rio de los Laxas,
which enters the Chagre a little above Cruces. This river flows
westward from Mount Maria Henrique; while the principal branches of
the Rio Grande, which flows south into the Pacific immediately to the
westward of Panama, spring from the south-west side of the mountain
already mentioned. The branches of this river and of the Chagre
approach very near each other; while savannahs, according to Lloyd's
map, fill up, as between the Rio Grande and the Obispo, the most of
the intervening space. In this short distance, and with the aid of
these rivers, a water communication, were the country properly
examined, it is conjectured, might be found. From Cruces the road, for
a short distance, ascends considerably; after which it runs along a
ridge, with a valley on each side; that on the south the deepest,
being about 300 feet, and descends until it comes to a plain, through
which it stretches and runs to the city of Panama. It is by quitting
the old Spanish track or road, and continuing along the savannahs and
levels, that it is believed the water communication adverted to could
be effected; and where the distance, taking into account the short
bends which may be necessary, is so short, probably not twenty miles!</p>

<p>These observations naturally call the attention to the consideration
of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page094" name="page094"></a>(p. 094)</span> a line of communication which may be had from the River
Trinidad to the Pacific, either at Panama or a little to the westward
of that town, in the bay of Chorera, at the mouth of the Rio Caymito.
The condition of the country in that portion of the Isthmus has
already been generally described, on the authority of Mr. Lloyd; and
from what he has stated, and which is in unison with other
information, not a doubt can remain that a water communication can be
opened up in this quarter from sea to sea. Lines for railroads have
already been chalked out in both places alluded to; and considered so
easy that the sum of 400,000 dollars is estimated as the whole expense
necessary to complete either. It is scarcely necessary to observe,
that wherever a rail-road can be constructed, a canal may be made. The
River Trinidad is a branch of the Chagre, which comes from the
westward and from the south-westward, and joins the latter at about
eight miles due S. W. from its mouth. The Trinidad is navigable to
Embracadero, and for some distance, from its mouth, is both broad and
deep. Its branches penetrate a considerable way into the country, and
approach closely to the branches of the Caymito, a considerable
stream, which flows through a country, in its lower course,
comparatively level; while between its upper course and the Trinidad
the distance is covered with savannahs and small conical hills, and in
some places marshy plains&mdash;a complete proof of the level nature of the
country. The streams which rise to the westward of the line alluded
to, namely, in the hills stretching to the province of Veragua, mostly
flow into the Chagre, another proof of the direction in which the
mountains in this quarter lay; and that there is no continued chain,
as has been stated, extending in the centre of the Isthmus throughout,
and joining together the Andes of North and South America. From the
junction of the Trinidad with the Chagre to Panama is only 26&frac12;
miles, and to the mouth of the Chorera 23 miles!</p>

<p>Short, however, as the distances just mentioned are, they are
considerably reduced, when the navigation of the Trinidad on the one
side, and of the Caymito on the other, are taken into account. These
reduce the greater distance at least one-half; and in it, as well as
the lesser distance, the nature of the country, for <span class="pagenum"><a id="page095" name="page095"></a>(p. 095)</span> a
considerable portion of the distance, if not throughout the whole
distance, overcomes almost every obstacle, or rather renders every
obstacle that may offer, possible to be overcome. From that portion of
the River Chagre, which is level with high-water mark at Panama,
south-westward to that city, the country is interspersed with
savannahs, and consequently level. Indeed, for "a few miles" inwards
from Panama, the <i>plains</i> are below the level of the sea, thus
rendering the formation of a canal easy; while, on the north side of
the most elevated spot, the numerous streams which spring and flow to
the Chagre would afford an abundant supply of water for any canal that
may be constructed, however large that may be. The distance,
therefore, where any serious difficulty could occur, must be reduced
to a mile or two; and in that distance, should any of those conical
mountains, from 300 to 500 feet high, or insulated ridges of
inconsiderable height, which Mr. Lloyd tells us are here and there to
be found in these places&mdash;should any such intervene, they may be cut
through without any great difficulty. The excess in the rise of the
tide in the Pacific, nearly 21 feet above its rise in the Atlantic,
would tend greatly to accelerate the construction, in this part of
America, of a water communication; which water communication, however,
be it observed, must be sufficient to admit the passage through it of
ships of the very highest tonnage, and at all seasons; otherwise it
will not answer the general purpose, nor interests of the world. Less
might indeed suit for the conveyance of mails; but any thing less
would occasion such an additional expense in unloading, transporting,
and again loading goods, as would render the tedious navigation of
Cape Horn preferable.</p>


<h4><i>Lake Nicaragua, &amp;c.</i></h4>

<p>The next to be considered, and perhaps the last and the best channel
by which a communication between the Atlantic and the Pacific could be
opened up, and safely carried on, is through central America, or the
Republic of Guatemala, by means of the River St. Juan and the Lakes
Nicaragua and Managua, or, as <span class="pagenum"><a id="page096" name="page096"></a>(p. 096)</span> the latter is more generally
called, Leon. These lakes are connected with each other by a river,
and are navigable for ships; Nicaragua for ships of the line. The
River St. Juan forms the outlet of both into the Atlantic Ocean, and
is, according to Estella, navigable throughout its course for ships of
large burden. The mouth of the St. Juan, according to the late survey
by Capt. Owen, lays in 10°53' N. lat. and in 83°40' W. long. Leon, the
capital of the province in which Lake Managua is situated, and from
which the name of Leon is generally given to the latter, stands,
according to the best Spanish authorities, in 12°20' N. lat. and
86°45' W. long.; and its port, Rialejo, on the Pacific, in 12°29'50"
N. lat., and 87°6' W. long. From the mouth of the River St. Juan to
Rialejo, in a bearing of N. 66° W. the distance is 235 miles; and this
bearing runs nearly through the centre of the lakes and the course of
the River St. Juan. From the point where the River St. Juan issues
from the Lake Nicaragua to the point where the River Lapita, which
issues from Lake Managua, falls into the former, the distance, taken
on the best maps, is about 95 miles. Rialejo is situated on a river of
the same name, which is deep, and capable of holding in the harbour
200 sail of the largest ships. The harbour is well protected from the
force of the Pacific, and from storms, by an island stretching out
before it, with two channels between it and the main land; the one
opening to the south-east, and the other to the north-west. The
adjacent country is very fertile, but the place itself is reckoned
unhealthy, owing to some swamps in the vicinity and to the southward;
but which, it is believed, might be drained and cleared, which would
render the climate salubrious, or, at least, as much so as any
tropical climate can be to Europeans.</p>

<p>Lake Nicaragua, in its broadest part, is about 35 miles: it has
several considerable islands, some of them active volcanoes, and all
of them fertile. The country around its shores is stated to be very
healthy and very fertile, and studded with high peaks, mostly
volcanic, and many of them, on both sides, volcanoes in activity. At
the point on its north-east corner, where the River St. Juan issues
from it, there is (according to some of our best maps) erected the
castle of St. Carlos; and lower <span class="pagenum"><a id="page097" name="page097"></a>(p. 097)</span> down, about 16 miles on the
banks of the river, is placed the castle of St. Juan, which castle was
taken by the English in 1780. Alcedo says that this river is navigable
for ships of large size; but others add, that during the dry season,
when the river is low, in one or two places the navigation is
obstructed by sand banks, which, however, could easily be removed by a
deepening machine, such as that used for a similar purpose on the
Clyde. Lake Managua in its western shore approaches in its southern
portion to within 8 to 9 miles of the Pacific; and here the conical
peak range appears to be discontinued and broken. So also it is in the
route from Leon to Rialejo, a distance of 21 miles. The next nearest
point of communication is to the southward of the town of Grenada,
situate on the upper part of Lake Nicaragua, westward to the port of
St. Juan, which runs considerably into the country from the Pacific.
Here the distance from the lake to the sea is 10 miles. The next point
of communication is from the neighbourhood of the town of Nicaragua to
the bottom of the Gulf of Papagayo, the distance being about 15 miles.
The river Partido flows from the S. E. through a course of fully 60
miles, and enters the Pacific at the bottom of the Gulf of Papagayo.
At this point, also, the volcanic peaks and the ridge appear to be
interrupted, and very low, thereby rendering a passage more probable
and easy. On the neck of land, also, between the upper part of Lake
Nicaragua and the Pacific, there are situated in three different
places between the Pacific and the interior part, three lakes, which,
while it shows the low nature of the coast, tends also to shorten very
considerably in this otherwise very narrow neck (12 miles), the space
that intervenes between the lake and the ocean.</p>

<p>The American coast of the Pacific is, in fact, bordered with an
alluvial plain, varying in breadth, which tends still more to lessen
the breadth of the high lands in every quarter. Between the bottom of
the Gulf of Papagayo to Lake Nicaragua, the distance, the alluvial
strip included, is, (see Journal R. G. S. vol. vi.), only 29,880
English yards, nearly 15 geographical miles. The highest point of land
that intervenes, is only 133&frac12; Spanish feet (the Spanish foot is
0.9267 English) above the level of the sea, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page098" name="page098"></a>(p. 098)</span> and only 19 feet
above the level of the lake. The lake is very deep, and at this point
is said to be 15 fathoms. The surface of the lake is thus 133&frac12;
Spanish feet above the level of both oceans. The tide in the Pacific
in the Gulf of Papagayo rises about 11 feet, decreasing in its rise
towards the north, and increasing its rise towards the south. When Mr.
Canning proclaimed that he had "<i>called a new world into existence</i>,"
he ought, as he then might, to have kept these places, the key to both
worlds, in his power, and in the power of his country.</p>

<p>Some Spanish authorities state, that Lake Nicaragua has a
communication with the Pacific, but at what point does not appear, nor
is it probable. Others state that it has a tide in it like the ocean;
and if so, this certainly indicates a communication with it by some
low and level channel, where the tide from the sea drives back the
flow of waters from the lake. To ascertain these points are objects of
great importance, and well worthy the attention of the civilized
world; and the wonder is, that it has not before this time been
attempted. All the old and best Spanish writers, who wrote either from
access to the best materials, or from practical information regarding
the Spanish territories in South America, but more especially Estalla
and Alcedo, mention, in the most pointed manner, that, by the places
which have just been considered, the nearest and the safest channel
would be found, nay actually existed, whereby a communication could be
opened up between the Atlantic and the Pacific; and farther, that the
possession and the command of Fort St. Juan and the river St. Juan on
the one hand, and of the port of Rialejo on the other, gave the holder
and possessor of them the key to and the command of both oceans. Like
the Gulf of Darien, all entrance into or examination of this quarter
of America by foreigners, or travellers in general, was prohibited by
the Spanish government, under the punishment of death for a violation
of the law. The Spaniards were particularly averse to and jealous of
England, or Englishmen, becoming acquainted with this portion of
America.</p>

<p>In some one of the points mentioned, and most probably from Lake
Managua to Rialejo, or from Lake Nicaragua to the Gulf of Papagayo,
the best line for a communication between the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page099" name="page099"></a>(p. 099)</span> Atlantic and
the Pacific will be found. The shores of Lake Nicaragua are tolerably
well cultivated, and it has several harbours. Numerous streams flow
into it from all sides, but particularly from the north. The river St.
Juan is a considerable stream&mdash;as large, say the Spanish writers, as
the Guadalquiver in its lower course. In a distance so short, a canal,
fit to bear ships of the very largest tonnage, could be cut, at
certainly no very heavy expense; say, at the rate of 300,000<i>l.</i> for
10 miles. Even if the river St. Juan should not be found to be
navigable, and that it might be most advisable to cut a canal along
its banks, from the Atlantic to the lake, the distance is not very
great (45 or 50 miles), and the country presents no insuperable
obstacles to it; on the contrary, it is believed to be easy of access.
This distance might be cut for 675,000<i>l.</i>&mdash;a small sum even joined to
the other, when the immense object to be attained is considered. The
choice of position, after considering attentively every point, will
remain between Chagre to Panama, and between St. Juan and Nicaragua to
Rialejo, as to which is the best line for a water communication; for
it is pretty clear that the lines to the eastward and to the southward
of Panama, narrow although the neck of land certainly is in these
parts, can only be looked to as points for a speedy road communication
in some, and for small craft in the others.</p>

<p>The jealousy of the government of Spain formerly sealed up every
possible line of communication between the Atlantic and the Pacific,
in all the places mentioned, from the rest of the world; and it is
probable that the jealousy, and also the poverty and inability of the
new governments lately started up in these parts may continue to do
so, if they are allowed to do so, or if they remain unaided in the
enterprise by foreign capital, and not be impelled thereto by foreign,
but particularly European influence. A glance at the map of these
parts of America, and at a map of the world, and a moment's reflection
and consideration bestowed on the great interests that depend upon it,
that would be laid open and connected by such a communication, is
sufficient to show the prodigious benefits which would therefrom flow
to the human race, and especially to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name="page100"></a>(p. 100)</span> the governments and the
people of North and South America, and those fine but comparatively
poor and miserable portions of this globe. The treasures and the
labours of nations would be well bestowed in completing such an
undertaking. Laying open such a communication would do more to people,
to cultivate, and to civilize the world, than any other effort&mdash;than
all other efforts made by the world at large, when combined and
brought together. No nation in the world is so deeply interested in
seeing a proper communication through the best of the channels pointed
out laid open, as Great Britain; and no other nation could so well
undertake it as she can. The immense empire which is rising under her
flag in New Holland; the large territory which she would thereby bring
within the sphere of cultivation and civilization on the west coast of
North America, to the north of Colombia River, where both the climate
and the soil are good; the vast and important trade which she has with
China, and may yet have with all the beautiful islands in the Pacific,
with Japan, and with all Eastern Siberia; and the very great trade
which she has, and would have with all the shores of America on the
Pacific,&mdash;all render the attainment of the object contemplated
peculiarly her interest, and peculiarly her province to undertake,
support, complete, and protect, in a way and on a scale worthy of the
intelligence, the enterprize, the strength, and the resources of her
government and her people. The number of people, and the traffic which
it would in time add to the present trade and population of the world,
exceed the powers of calculation.</p>

<p>Taking Lake Nicaragua as the point for the communication between the
two seas, the calculations which have been made as to periods and
distances connected with the conveyance of mails from Europe, in order
to cross the Pacific, will not be materially different from those
which would arise were Panama to be chosen as the point of
communication. Confining every thing to this route, it is necessary to
consider and to show what advantage trade and commerce would derive
from it; what extent of commerce would pass through this line of
communication;, and what revenue could reasonably, and with
propriety, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page101" name="page101"></a>(p. 101)</span> be raised therefrom, in order to prove a
remuneration for the expense of the undertaking.</p>

<p>The official records of British trade and commerce, and also the
official records of the trade and commerce of the United States, will
enable us to estimate these points just alluded to, for the present
period, with considerable accuracy. From both records, the following
extent and amount of imports and exports, and tonnage, engaged in
transporting these, are selected; premising that, as regards both
countries, the value of each is, without either freight or charges:
and as regards the former, viz. Great Britain, the value taken is what
is denominated, in the Customs return, "<i>the declared value</i>," and
which, exclusive of freight and charges, is considerably below the
real amount. The commerce of both states mentioned, with all the
countries about to be enumerated, would most certainly pass through
the channel already alluded to, besides a considerable portion more
from other countries, but which is uncertain.</p>

<p>Exclusive <span class="pagenum"><a id="page102" name="page102"></a>(p. 102)</span> of specie&mdash;the amount of which, from the western
coasts of America, cannot be less than 10,000,000 dollars yearly to
Great Britain, and perhaps half as much to the United States. The
value of British imports from Western America is not given in the
official tables in any tangible shape, and therefore the imports are
taken to be the same as the exports. The amount of imports from China
is taken correctly from the tables; and the value of all the rest, as
near as possible, from the same tables, in proportion; the whole being
entered to all countries east of the Cape, China excepted; but in this
amount also the amount for freight and charges should, it is thought,
be added. The proportion of foreign and colonial produce, &amp;c. to
British manufactures exported, is, according to the official tables,
as near as may be, the proportion taken. The value of the whole
British trade to the places specified, may therefore be fairly taken
at 17,500,000<i>l.</i> exports and imports, and exclusive of the profits
thereon.</p>

<p>Next comes the trade which the United States have with all these
places. In this there are more precise data, as the value both of
exports and imports is given in their tables; but it may be observed,
that the amount, both as regards imports and exports, is given
exclusive of freights and charges, which in almost all the articles
carried is greater in proportion, as regards the American trade, than
in British produce and manufactures. It may also be observed, that the
whole trade which the United States have with all countries to the
eastward of the Mauritius, would pass through, and return through, the
communication made in central America, as the nearest and the best
route for them. The following was the trade and tonnage of the United
States with the places specified in 1835:&mdash;</p>

<p>To the above should be added all the specie sent both by Great Britain
and the United States to the Eastern World, particularly to China, to
purchase cargoes, from the States alone about 7,000,000 dolls.; also
all the tonnage which goes, or would go, from one coast to another in
the three republics of Venezuela, Guatemala, and Mexico. To these
states, such a communication would prove of inestimable value, and
tend very greatly to add to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page104" name="page104"></a>(p. 104)</span> the revenue to be obtained from
the traffic by it. There are other nations, also, besides Great
Britain and the United States, which traffic with the quarters of the
world already specifically alluded to, particularly France, Spain, and
Holland; but no accurate account of such trade has hitherto come in
the writer's way; though, taken collectively, it must be to a
considerable amount. Moreover, the whole trade between Holland and
Java, and between Spain and the Philippine Islands, would pass by the
channel under consideration, and the trade which both nations has with
these places is well known to be very considerable.</p>

<p>Such as it has been described is the trade at this moment; a sure
foundation upon which the magnificent undertaking under consideration
would, at the outset, have to build. The increased and increasing
communications through the grand thoroughfare goes beyond calculation,
and would most certainly exceed every thing that ever has been seen,
or that ever can be witnessed, in any other portion of this globe. The
trade of mighty empires would sink into insignificance, when compared,
in all their present magnitude, with what it would become one hundred
years hence. Admitting that it cost 1,000,000<i>l.</i> to complete the
navigable communication, (and there are good grounds to believe that
it could be done for one-half of the sum,) the question or point next
to be considered is, what would the revenue be, which could be derived
from it? To exact a per centage on the value of the commerce which
passes through it would be uncertain, and liable to evasion, and
consequently give much trouble, and occasion much vexation; and
therefore it would be best to exact so much per ton, the exact extent
of which the register of each ship or vessel so passing through the
canal would at once and readily determine. The question is, What
should the sum so levied, or the toll, actually come to be? Ten
shillings per ton would certainly be a moderate sum; and taking it so
it will be shown how it will pay at the outset.</p>

may reasonably be expected to be doubled in a very few years

<h4><i>Conveyance Mails and Passengers.</i></h4>

<p>Hitherto the matter has been considered entirely as relates to the
practicability and probable expenditure to be incurred in carrying the
Plan into effect, and the remuneration to be obtained from the Plan
when completed. It yet remains to show the advantages which will be
obtained in the courses and distances by this route, as compared with
other routes, and also with the route by the North Pole&mdash;even were
this latter practicable throughout the year, but which it almost
certainly is not. It has elsewhere been shown how a communication
across any part of this Isthmus, even by an ordinary road, can be made
to extend, and to accelerate the mail communications between Great
Britain and all the western coasts of America, and more especially
with the most eastern parts of the eastern world, and her own rising
empire in New Holland. Nothing calls forth the enterprize and the
energies of mankind, equal to the rapidity and regularity of
correspondence: and without this, no country can either improve or
advance in cultivation or civilization.</p>

<p>The comparative distances by the several lines of communication will
stand as follow:&mdash;</p>

<p>Thus <span class="pagenum"><a id="page108" name="page108"></a>(p. 108)</span> it is evident, that were the passage over the North Pole
open and practicable at all seasons, but which it is not, the route by
it would be so much shorter for every part from Europe to the ports in
Asia and in America, situated on the Northern Pacific, as to be vastly
preferable; but when it is recollected that this passage can only be
open for a very few months in the course of the year&mdash;and also
considering the winds and the weather which, during that brief space
of time, would certainly be met with in the northern route, and the
utter impossibility that there would be of procuring any assistance in
that route, should accidents occur,&mdash;it is clear, that vessels would
almost as speedily, and certainly much more safely, run over the
distances by the western route, even to the places more near; while,
as regards those which are more distant, there can and need be no
comparison drawn.</p>

<p>It will also from these references be observed, that the distances to
all the eastern parts of Asia, and the north-west coast of America,
are, with a very few exceptions (in these, too, the distances are
nearly equal), nearer than the distances would be, either taken by the
Cape of Good Hope or Cape Horn, the only routes always open; while,
considering the winds and the seas which are met with in either of
these routes, it is plain that ships would run over the distance by
the western route through central America, even to the most distant
parts in eastern Asia that have been adverted to, sooner and much
easier than they could do by either of the former. The saving of
insurance alone in the route by the mild tropical climates, and also
of wear and tear in ships by the same channel, compared to what all
these would amount to in the navigation by the other routes, to say
nothing of the saving of time in voyages, would be objects of great
importance to commercial and nautical men.</p>

<h2>POSTAGES, PROBABLE AMOUNT, INCREASE, &amp;c.</h2>

<p>In the General Post-office Accounts for 1836 (see Finance Accounts,
1837, p. 55), there is charged the sum of 9,406<i>l.</i> 7<i>s.</i> 5&frac14;<i>d.</i>,
as the sum paid for ship letters. For each letter received by a ship
not a regular packet, 2d. is paid by the Post Office at landing, and
which gives the number of such letters to be 1,128,764 yearly. Suppose
400,000 of these went by packets under the new arrangements, the
additional Post-office revenue therefrom would be 16,665<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The sum just mentioned as paid for ship letters may be stated as
principally attached to ship letters brought from all places in the
Western World. According to a return to the House of Commons (see East
India Steam Communication Report, 1837), the number of ship letters
from India for 1836, was 159,360. The New York packet ships alone
carry from 5000 to 6000 letters each. Twice each month the proposed
packets to and from England would bear an equal, perhaps even a
greater, number, under the proposed regular and prompt arrangement:
certainly all the Canadian correspondence will be very greatly
increased. This number, however, in four voyages each month, backwards
and forwards, gives at the rate, in round numbers, of 290,000 each
year. At 9<i>d.</i> each letter, the additional packet postage beyond the
ship-letter rate, would be 10,875<i>l.</i> gained to the British Post
Office.</p>

<p>In the Accounts above referred to, p. 54, there is entered 75,484<i>l.</i>
10<i>s.</i> 8&frac14;<i>d.</i>, charged on the postmasters in the British West
Indies, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page116" name="page116"></a>(p. 116)</span> and in British America. This sum is doubtless for
the unpaid letters outwards, and perhaps some internal postage. The
return postage from these quarters will exceed this sum, because more
double and treble letters come inwards than are sent outwards. There
is also a considerable sum paid in this country for letters sent by
post to the British Colonies.</p>

<p>In the same accounts there is entered, p. 54, 83,610<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>
received by the window men, &amp;c. at the Foreign Post Office. A portion
of this must be for the letters outwards to the Brazils, to St.
Thomas, to the French Islands, to Honduras, to Mexico, to Havannah,
and all places in central South America, for all of which places the
postage must be paid before the letter can be forwarded. How much of
the above sum is for the purpose alluded to, is not stated, but let it
be taken at 30,000<i>l.</i> yearly outwards, and an equal sum from the same
places inwards; together, 60,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>Next, there would be the gain on the <span class="smcap">New Line</span> between Halifax, New
York, and the West Indies; or, more correctly speaking, between <i>all</i>
North America and <i>all</i> the West Indies, from Demerara to Mexico
inclusive, and including also the shores of South America on the east,
and all its western coasts, from Valparaiso on the south, to Nootka
Sound on the north. The exports and imports to and from these
quarters, with all quarters of the world, amount, in goods, produce,
specie and bills, and freights, &amp;c. to upwards of 80,000,000<i>l.</i> a
year. The letters to which this vast trade, especially as the whole of
it is carried on by means of correspondence, must give rise, will be
immense: and yet, with the exception of the scanty mail communication
afforded by Britain to a few places, there is none to be found. The
amount of the trade here stated, includes of course the trade with all
places in Europe. The portion which is exclusively Colonial and
American, and which would of course be attached to the new line
alluded to, cannot be less in exports and imports than 30,000,000<i>l.</i>
yearly. The proportionate postage from this commerce, even at the
ratio of the present West Indian postage, to and from Great Britain
and her West Indian colonies, would be 110,000<i>l.</i> yearly; but
admitting that a sum equal to <i>one-half</i> only of <i>this sum</i> came from
the letters sent through the British Post Office, the sum gained on
this station yearly would be 55,000<i>l.</i></p>

<p>To all these sums must be added a considerable sum in postages, which
would be annually drawn from the correspondence between all parts
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page117" name="page117"></a>(p. 117)</span> of the United States, and Maranham, Pernambuco, Bahia, Rio de
Janeiro, Montevideo, Buenos Ayres, &amp;c. which would go by the British
packets from all these places to Fayal, and thence on, without any
delay, to New York. What this will be, it is impossible to estimate;
but taking the trade of the United States with these places as a
basis, it can hardly be less than 10,000<i>l.</i>, or more probably
12,000<i>l.</i> per annum.</p>

<p>The postages derived at present from the packet intercourse with the
whole Western World is taken at 200,000<i>l.</i> outwards and inwards. It
is not too much to estimate, that under the new and extended
communications and arrangements, more regular and frequent, this sum
would be increased <i>one-third</i>, or 66,666<i>l.</i>; together, 266,666<i>l.</i>
yearly. To this there is to be added the additions, as are previously
noted; together 92,540<i>l.</i>; making the sum total at least 359,206<i>l.</i>
per annum. The estimated expenditure for conveying the whole of the
mails by steam, which are calculated to produce this yearly revenue,
is 252,850<i>l.</i>, or a gain of 106,356<i>l.</i> The present revenue barely
pays the expenditure, if so much, of the establishment, consisting of
thirty sailing packets; four steamers in the West Indies; ten mail
boats (6000<i>l.</i> yearly) there; some sailing vessels at Halifax, and
very frequently, a considerable assistance from ships of war besides!</p>

<p>It has been stated (see <a href="#page003">p. 3</a>) that many letters by packets from
foreign parts are returned unopened to the Post-Office, in order to
save the postages, because the originals or duplicates had previously
been received through private channels. It would be useful and
important to ascertain the number of these. In the Finance Accounts

<p>The arrivals at, departures from, and the returns to Fayal, of the
packets for all quarters, will correspond so well with the arrival
outwards of the steamers from Falmouth, that no material delay on the
part of the steamers bearing all the return mails to Falmouth will be
occasioned or required. But because February has only twenty-eight
days, the mails, to make all coincide more nearly, should be made up
in London, instead of the 1st and 15th of February, on the 30th of
January, and 13th of the former month. The following, however, taking
the despatch of the mails from London according to the days in each
month, will show the periods of the whole:&mdash;</p>

<p>The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page122" name="page122"></a>(p. 122)</span> following will be the periods of the steamers between
Halifax and Havannah, from which it will appear how well the whole
will work as regards all North America and all the West Indies; and
also how regularly and pointedly the return steamer from the Havannah
(bringing the Havannah and Tampico mails, should any accident have
happened to the Jamaica steamer), will call at New York for the
replies to the letters by the packet from Europe, arrived at that city
two days before her; and carry these forward to Halifax (giving two
days to stop at New York) in time to get the steamer with the homeward
British mails from that place to Fayal.</p>

<h4><i>Speed, &amp;c. of Steam Boats</i>.</h4>

<p>In the Sixth Report of the Post-office Commissioners, p. 281, it is
stated that the Malta steamers average 7&frac12; miles per hour, and have
done so for a period of two years. The Dublin and Liverpool Steam
Post-office packets average also 7&frac12; miles per hour, or 180 miles
daily.</p>

<p>In the same Report, p. 265, Mr. Napier states, that he built the
steamers which run between Dundee and London; and that during a period
of eighteen months they have averaged 11&frac12; miles per hour. This, it
is believed, means British miles, or 10 geographical miles. At the
latter rate they run 240 miles per day. During the period above
mentioned, these boats have not cost their owners 18<i>l.</i> for repairs
to the machinery. A steam-boat of 240-horse power would at that time
(1836) cost 24,000<i>l.</i> to 25,000<i>l.</i>, burden 620 tons. A contractor,
to keep them in repair, would require 1,000<i>l.</i> per annum.</p>

<p>According to accounts lately received from the East, the <i>Berenice</i>,
with only one engine, the other having been broken, ran from Socotora
to Suez, a distance of 1800 miles, in 9&frac12; days. The Leith and London
Steamers, such as the <i>Monarch</i>, of 200-horse power, run the distance,
415 geographical miles, in 45 hours,&mdash;the average of voyages during
the year; and frequently the distance is run in 40 hours, and even
less.</p>

<p>There never having been heretofore any regular packet conveyance to
and from India, there are consequently no accurate returns of the
postage received, or letters that are conveyed backwards and forwards
between England and the vast countries to the eastward of the Cape of
Good Hope. The number, however, from the extent of the trade, must be
very great; and not a doubt can remain, that if regular and speedy
conveyances were established, the numbers would be very much
increased. In a communication from Col. Maberly, Secretary to the
General Post Office, printed by order of the House of Commons last
year, along with the Evidence taken before the Committee appointed to
consider the propriety of establishing a Steam Communication with
India, that gentleman gives the whole amount of postage outwards for
1836 to Cadiz, Gibraltar, Malta, and Corfu, at 3411<i>l.</i>, and reckons
the amount inwards at the same sum. He estimates the whole postage
outwards and inwards, including sea postage between England, Ceylon,
India, and the Mediterranean, at 47,000<i>l.</i> Even this sum, which
certainly by no means includes every letter to and from the places
mentioned, would, under the arrangements proposed, be doubled,
independently of all the postages which would be obtained from the New
South Wales, China, and Batavia, &amp;c. &amp;c. trade. The coasting or
internal postages of Hindostan would certainly be greatly increased.</p>

<p>In <span class="pagenum"><a id="page128" name="page128"></a>(p. 128)</span> the Finance Accounts of 1837, p. 55, there is charged the
sum of 14,216<i>l.</i> 19<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i> for transit postage through foreign
countries. Much of this is doubtless from letters which come through
France, &amp;c. from the Mediterranean, and countries near that sea. Under
the proposed regular and frequent packet arrangement, the letters from
which much of this sum is obtained would come directly through the
British Post Office.</p>

<p>The amount of postage to be obtained through the vast range of
countries which the New Plan proposes to embrace, can only be
conjectured by considering the immense trade which is carried on with
them and by them. As it is very great, so must the correspondence to
which it gives rise be.</p>


<h4><i>Mauritius and Socotora.</i></h4>

<p>An error has been committed in stating the expense on this station
(see <a href="#page068">page 68</a>.) Three sailing-vessels, instead of two, will be
required; thus adding 4000<i>l.</i> to the capital, and 2000<i>l.</i> to the
yearly expenditure.</p>

<hr>

<p>Including the Mediterranean, the yearly cost of the present Foreign
Packet conveyances, limited, uncertain, and irregular as the whole is,
cannot be less than 350,000<i>l.</i>, exclusive of any sum set apart to
replace the capital engaged in it.</p>

<p>If the East Indian communication is amalgamated with the plan for the
Western World to Pernambuco by Fayal, as it may readily be, then a
considerable further reduction of expenditure in the former can be
made (including the sailing-vessels between Rio de Janeiro and Buenos
Ayres) in capital 106,000<i>l.</i> and in direct yearly charges 45,000<i>l.</i>;
and nevertheless extend the steam conveyance to Buenos Ayres by Rio de
Janeiro from Pernambuco. This desirable object could be effected with
the saving mentioned, and without creating any additional delay in the
communication; because, if the communication by this route between
Falmouth and the Cape of Good Hope can be effected, as it may be,
within 75 days, then no delay in the course of the mails takes place,
while a considerable expense is saved, and important additional
accommodation is afforded to the public, and to the commercial world.
The distance from Falmouth to the Cape of Good Hope by Fayal and
Pernambuco, is 7330 geographical <span class="pagenum"><a id="page129" name="page129"></a>(p. 129)</span> miles. This could be run in
75 days: thus&mdash;36 days outwards, and 34 days inwards: 215 geographical
miles per day in the latter, and 203 geographical miles in the former.</p>

<p>The course of mails from Falmouth to Canton, by Isthmus of America, by
Rialejo, will be 173 days; and to Sydney, by the same route, 158 days.</p>

<hr>

<h4><i>Isthmus of America.</i></h4>

<p>The appearance of the Isthmus of America, from Darien to the borders
of Mexico, indicates, in a very forcible manner, that this portion of
the earth is a fragment of a larger portion, which had, at some
important epoch, been to a great extent submerged around it, and that
the present Isthmus is the remains of a wider continental tract. In
several places within the limits mentioned, the ridges are broken, and
the country abounds&mdash;in fact, is studded&mdash;with high peaks, isolated,
yet greatly elevated. To the southward of Lake Nicaragua, between 9°
and 10° North latitude, about Cortago or Carthage, the land, or rather
ridge, is so elevated, that although within thirty miles of the
Pacific on the one hand, and forty miles of the Atlantic on the other
hand, yet during the winter months, from November to March, frost and
ice abound. The climate everywhere, in the interior parts, is
represented as being very healthy, and the country fruitful and
pleasant.</p>

<h3>THE END.</h3>


<p><a id="footnote1" name="footnote1"></a>
<b>Footnote 1:</b> The Island of Fayal is chosen as the point of
communication in preference to Terceira, &amp;c. because during the few
months when one side is exposed to storms, the other side is well
sheltered, and the distance is very short from the one side to the
anchorage on the other. As each of the steamers from the westward and
southward will proceed to Falmouth in her turn, so if all the mails
are up at Fayal before the outward steamer arrives from Falmouth, the
steamer whose turn it is to proceed on to Falmouth, will go forward
with the mails without any delay, except to take in coals.<a href="#footnotetag1">(Back)</a></p>

<p><a id="footnote2" name="footnote2"></a>
<b>Footnote 2:</b> Should the Colombian Government obstinately and
ignorantly oppose the transmission of mails across the isthmus from
Chagres to Panama, or propose to shackle this point of communication
with unreasonable and inadmissible restrictions, then in that case
there remains a point, it is believed, more practicable, safer, and
more eligible, where the communication could be effected, namely, in
the State of Guatemala, or Central America, by the River St. Juan's
and Lake Nicaragua, both of which are navigable for vessels of any
size. The south-west shores of the lake in question approach to within
fourteen or fifteen miles of the Pacific, and this distance, in one
place, through a valley nearly level throughout, and at but little
elevation above the level of the sea. From Lake Managua, or Leon, the
distance to the sea is still shorter, being, in one place, according
to good maps, not more than eight to ten miles. From this lake also,
and the capital, Leon, the distance north-west to Rialejo, a fine port
on the Pacific, is twenty-three miles, and through an accessible, if
not very easy country. The Government of the Republic of Guatemala, or
Central America, would doubtless be ready to afford every facility to
open such a communication, which would prove the greatest and most
certain means of improving their country. Moreover, if a ready
communication is once afforded, from any point on the east coast of
America, in the places alluded to, it would speedily become the object
and the interest of the Chilian, the Peruvian, and the Mexican
Governments to watch and to see that the communication with the world
to the eastward should not only be rendered secure, but be maintained.
Also, with a communication opened in this quarter, such as it is
believed can be opened, the commerce and communications between North
America and Europe, and New South Wales, China, and all Eastern Asia,
would most certainly, as it could most advantageously and
expeditiously, be carried on by it.<a href="#footnotetag2">(Back)</a></p>

<b>Footnote 4:</b> To touch at Savannah la Mar would scarcely take up one
hour, while doing so would be a very great accommodation to the
western part of Jamaica.<a href="#footnotetag4">(Back)</a></p>

<p><a id="footnote5" name="footnote5"></a>
<b>Footnote 5:</b> If the packet is a steamer, these boats will be saved,
because the steamer would save so much time as to enable it to call at
all the islands northwards, to pick up the return mails.<a href="#footnotetag5">(Back)</a></p>

<p><a id="footnote6" name="footnote6"></a>
<b>Footnote 6:</b> Whenever steamers are appointed to carry the mails from
Falmouth to Barbadoes, the arrival of the packet at that island will
be so regular, that Jamaica <i>might</i> be made (should this be considered
advantageous) the headquarters, as it were, for the steamers in that
quarter of the world. Four would then be sufficient for the work
between Barbadoes and Vera Cruz; two to run between Jamaica and Vera
Cruz, by the Havannah, and two between Jamaica and Barbadoes, by St.
Thomas. The latter two would be each fifteen days at sea monthly, and
the former two seventeen days, exclusive of partial stoppages; so that
there would be abundance of time for rest and repairs. Further, under
such circumstances, the packet with the European return mails would
have time to run through the islands and pick up all the mails;
meeting, on the second day after her departure from Trinidad, and on
the ninth after reaching Barbadoes, at St. Lucia, the steamer from
Guiana, with the Guiana, Tobago, and Barbadoes return mails; and
proceeding onward through all the islands, to the northward and
westward, St. Thomas and Porto Rico included, pass from that island
through the Mona Passage, and call at Jacmel for a mail, reaching
Jamaica in fourteen days. From thence starting without delay, and
going by St. Jago de Cuba and Cape Nichola, leave the latter place on
the seventeenth day for Fayal, exactly in the same time that it is
calculated it could do under the other arrangement. But such an
arrangement would render it difficult, perhaps impracticable, to get
up the Laguayra mail to St. Thomas in time, it having only ten days
for that purpose; and at the same time an additional expense for
coals, at least for three days each packet or voyage (1800 tons,
2250<i>l.</i> yearly) would be required, being the time taken between
Jamaica and Cape Nichola Mole.<a href="#footnotetag6">(Back)</a></p>

<p><a id="footnote7" name="footnote7"></a>
<b>Footnote 7:</b> The cost of these steamers will, to a considerable
degree, depend on the tonnage which it is considered most proper to
adopt. The utmost quantity of coals which any of them will require to
carry, will be (Fayal to Barbadoes, and Fayal to Pernambuco) 300 tons.
Airy accommodation for from fifty to sixty cabin passengers, and
twenty-five to thirty steerage ditto, with the crew, will be all that
is requisite, leaving a room for specie and the mails, and space for
from forty to one hundred tons of goods. Since the present calculation
was made, the price of machinery has risen considerably. Boats of the
size necessary may now, perhaps, cost 28,000<i>l.</i> to 29,000<i>l.</i> In the
latter case, 750<i>l.</i> per annum (five per cent. insurance, five per
cent. interest, and five per cent. ordinary tear and wear) must be
added to the yearly outlay, as here stated. The wages and provisions
will remain the same. Iron boats can be had <i>one-fourth</i> cheaper than
those built of wood; moreover, engines now made on the <span class="smcap">EXPANSIVE</span>
system, require fully one-third fewer coals, by which so much expense
will be saved.<a href="#footnotetag7">(Back)</a></p>

<b>Footnote 15:</b> By making the four steamers on the route between the
Cape of Good Hope and Ceylon, run&mdash;two from the Cape to Mauritius, and
two from Mauritius to Point de Galle, the boats on the eastern side of
the Mauritius would regularly have eight days, and those on the
western side six days each month to rest; and furthermore, be always
prepared to start whenever a steamer from either quarter with mails
came up. In a similar manner, the boats which are to run between
Falmouth and the Cape of Good Hope could be divided; by which means,
besides being always ready when wanted, they also would have more time
to rest. Two may run from Falmouth to Cape Verde, 2300 miles; three
from Cape Verde to the Cape of Good Hope, 3850 miles; with one, the
fourth, to take by turns a voyage from Cape Verde to the Cape of Good
Hope, and a voyage from Cape Verde to Falmouth, in order to relieve
the others. Sufficient time for rest would thus be obtained. Moreover,
by combining the East Indian Department with the Plan for the Western
World by Fayal to Pernambuco, three steamers would be saved. The
Indian steamers to branch off at the latter place for the Cape. The
distance would, in this way, be increased about 1000 miles; but
considering the winds and currents in the course which these steamers
would take, it would not make three days more, if so much, in the
outward voyage, and in the homeward voyage probably not so much; while
the advantages would be considerable, and the saving great.<a href="#footnotetag15">(Back)</a></p>

<p><b>Footnote 16:</b> The time here is only ten days; but the calculation was

thought necessary to alter it.</p>

<p>The time in which the different distances may be run has been here
stated, but the necessary arrangements for the arrivals and departures
of the mails will, in some instances, extend that time. These
arrangements resolve the periods into&mdash;say 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120,
&amp;c. &amp;c. days. Thus, if the mails between Alexandria and Bombay cannot
be back at Alexandria, as they really cannot be, within 30 days, the

observation, Chagres in 9° 18' 40" N. lat., and Panama in 8° 57' 41"
N. lat. Not being able to observe an eclipse of Jupiter's satellites,
owing to the obscuration of the atmosphere, he was obliged to
calculate the longitude from bearings and distances. In these,
however, he could not be far wrong; and by these he places Cruces 21'
east of Chagre, and Panama 9'30" east of Chagre, which, if he is
correct, brings the breadth of the land from the Castle of Chagre to
Panama, to be only 23 geographical miles!!</p>

<p>Since the preceding pages were written, Captain Washington, secretary
to the Royal Geographical Society, has favoured me with the longitudes
of the places adverted to, as ascertained by Captain Forster, and in
February 1837 by Captain Belcher, R.N. Porto Bello is in 79° 30' West
long.; Chagre, 79° 55'; and Panama in 79° 29' 20". This gives the
distance from Chagre to Panama 33 geographical miles. Porto Bello is
in lat. 9° 32' North. From thence to the Pacific, a little to the east
of Panama, is 30 miles. From Chagre to the mouth of the Caymito will
be 30 miles. Ulloa's calculations of longitudes would thus appear to
be wrong.<a href="#footnotetag18">(Back)</a></p></div>
